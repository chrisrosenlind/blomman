FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP
Atlas Copco 2019
67
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The consolidated financial statements comprise Atlas Copco AB, the Parent 
Company (“the Company”), and its subsidiaries (together “the Group” or Atlas 
Copco) and the Group’s interest in associated companies and joint ventures. 
Atlas Copco AB is headquartered in Nacka, Sweden.
Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the EU. The 
statements are also prepared in accordance with the Swedish recommendation 
RFR 1 “Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups” and applicable statements 
issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board. These require certain addi-
tional disclosures for Swedish consolidated financial statements prepared in 
accordance with IFRS.
The accounting principles set out below have been consistently applied to all 
periods presented, unless otherwise stated, and for all entities included in the 
consolidated financial statements. The annual report for the Group and for Atlas 
Copco AB, including financial statements, was approved for issuance on Febru-
ary 28, 2020. The balance sheets and income statements are subject to approval 
by the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders on April 23, 2020.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the acquisition method. Accordingly, business combinations are seen as if the 
Group directly acquires the assets and assumes the liabilities of the entity 
acquired. The consolidated income statements and balance sheets of the Group 
include all entities in which the Company, directly or indirectly, has control. 
Control exists when the Company has power over the entity, is exposed, or 
has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the 
ability to use its power to aﬀect its returns. Generally, control and hence consoli-
dation is based on ownership. In a few exceptions, consolidation is based on 
agreements that give the Group control over an entity. See note A22 for infor-
mation on the Group’s subsidiaries.  
Intra-group balances and internal income and expense arising from intra-
group transactions are fully eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. Gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions that are rec-
ognized in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full, but 
losses only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Business combinations
At the acquisition date, i.e. the date on which control is obtained, each identifi-
able asset acquired and liability assumed is recognized at its acquisition-date 
fair value. The consideration transferred, measured at fair value, includes assets 
transferred by the Group, liabilities to the former owners of the acquiree and the 
equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Any 
subsequent change in such fair value is recognized in profit or loss, unless the 
contingent consideration is classified as equity. Transactions costs that the 
Group incur in connection with a business combination are expensed as 
incurred.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration trans-
ferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair 
value of the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over 
the net of acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed. 
Non-controlling interest is initially measured either 
• at fair value, or 
• at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the fair value of  
identifiable net assets. 
Subsequent profit or loss attributable to the non-controlling interest is allo-
cated to the non-controlling interest, even if it puts the non-controlling interest 
in a deficit position. Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are recognized as a 
transaction between equity attributable to owners of the parent and non-con-
trolling interests. The diﬀerence between consideration paid and the propor-
tionate share of net assets acquired is recognized in equity. For details on the 
acquisitions made during the year, see note 2.
Associated companies and joint ventures
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not 
control, over financial and operating policies. When the Group holds 20–50% of 
the voting power, it is presumed that significant influence exists, unless other-
wise demonstrated. A joint venture is an entity over which the Group has joint 
control, through contractual agreements with one or more parties. Investments 
in associated companies and joint ventures are reported according to the equity 
method. This means that the carrying value of interests in an associate or joint 
venture corresponds to the Group’s share of reported equity of the associate or 
1.
Significant accounting principles, critical accounting estimates and judgements
joint venture, plus any goodwill, and any other remaining fair value adjustments 
recognized at acquisition date. 
“Shares of profit in associated companies and joint ventures”, included in the 
income statements, comprises the Group’s share of the associate’s and joint 
venture’s income after tax adjusted for any amortization and depreciation, 
impairment losses, and other adjustments arising from any remaining fair value 
adjustments recognized at acquisition date. Dividends received from an associ-
ated company or joint venture reduce the carrying value of the investment.
Unrealized gains and losses arising from transactions with an associate or a 
joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest, but losses only 
to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment of the asset. When the 
Group’s share of losses in an associate or a joint venture equals or exceeds its 
interest in the associate or joint venture, the Group does not recognize further 
losses unless the Group has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of 
the associate.
Functional currency and foreign currency translation 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Swedish krona (SEK), 
which is the functional currency for Atlas Copco AB and also the presentation 
currency for the Group’s financial reporting. Unless otherwise stated, the 
amounts presented are in millions Swedish krona (MSEK).
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items carried at historical 
cost are reported using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction and 
non-monetary items carried at fair value are reported at the rate that existed 
when the fair values were determined. Tangible and intangible assets, inventory 
and advanced payments are examples of non-monetary items. 
Receivables and liabilities and other monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies are translated using the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet 
date. The exchange gains and losses related to receivables and payables and 
other operating receivables and liabilities are included in “Other operating 
income and expenses” and foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to 
other financial assets and liabilities are included in “Financial income and 
expenses”. Exchange rate diﬀerences on translation to functional currency are 
reported in other comprehensive income in the following cases: 
• translation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment 
in a foreign operation,
• translation of intra-group receivables from, or liabilities to, a foreign opera-
tion that in substance is part of the net investment in the foreign operation,
• cash flow hedges of foreign currency to the extent that the hedge is eﬀective. 
In the consolidation, the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated to 
SEK using exchange rates at the end of the reporting period and the income 
statements are translated at the average rates for the reporting period. Foreign 
exchange diﬀerences arising on such translation are recognized in other com-
prehensive income and are accumulated in the currency translation reserve in 
equity. Exchange rates for major currencies that have been used for the consoli-
dated financial statements are shown in note 27.
Segment reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business 
activities from which it may earn revenue and incur expenses, and for which dis-
crete financial information is available. The operating results of all operating 
segments are reviewed regularly by the Group’s President and CEO, the chief 
operating decision maker, to make decisions about allocation of resources to 
the segments and also to assess their performance. See note 4 for additional 
information.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the expected and entitled  
consideration for transferring goods and or services to customers when control 
has passed to the customer.
Goods sold
Revenue from goods sold are recognized at one point in time when control of 
the good has been transferred to the customer. This occurs for example when 
the Group has a present right to payment for the good, the customer has legal 
title of the good, the good has been delivered to the customer and or the cus-
tomer has the significant risks and rewards of the ownership of the good.
When the goods sold are highly customized and an enforceable right to pay-
ment is present, revenue is recognized over time using the proportion of cost 
incurred to date compared to estimated total cost to measure the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation and thereby 
transferring the control of the good to the customer. 
For buy-back commitments where the buy-back price is lower than the origi-
nal selling price but there is an economic incentive for the customer to use the 
buy-back commitment option, the transaction is accounted for as a lease. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP

Atlas Copco 2019
Variable consideration
Some contracts with customers provide a right of return, trade discounts or vol-
ume rebates. If revenue cannot be reliably measured, the Group defers revenue 
until the uncertainty is resolved. Such liabilities are estimated at contract incep-
tion and updated thereafter. 
Rights of return
When a contract with a customer provides a right to return the good within a 
specified period, the Group accounts for the right of return using the expected 
value method. The amount of revenue related to the expected returns is deferred 
and recognized in the statement of financial position within “Other liabilities”.  
A corresponding adjustment is made to the cost of sales and recognized in the 
statement of financial position within “Inventories”.
Rendering of service
Revenue from service is recognized over time by reference to the progress 
towards satisfaction of each performance obligation. The progress towards 
satisfaction of each performance obligation is measured by the proportion of 
cost incurred to date compared to estimated total cost of each performance 
obligation. 
Where the outcome of a service contract cannot be estimated reliably, reve-
nue is recognized to the extent of cost incurred that are expected to be recover-
able. When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total revenue, the 
expected loss is recognized as an expense immediately. When the value of the 
service performed to the customer corresponds directly to the right to invoice 
for that service, revenue is recognized to the amount invoiced. 
Specialty rental
Income from specialty rental is recognized on a straight-line basis over the rental 
period. The specialty rental business is considered to be a service for the custom-
ers as this includes a complete solution to the customers to fulfill the customer 
needs. Sale of equipment from the specialty rental business is recognized as rev-
enue when the control of the asset has been transferred to the buyer. Indicators 
of transfer of control is explained under “Goods sold” see page 67. The carrying 
value of the specialty rental equipment sold is recognized as cost of sales. Invest-
ments in and sales of specialty rental equipment are included in cash flows from 
operating activities.
Contract assets and contract liabilities
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed 
account receivables, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer 
advances and deposits (contract liabilities) in the consolidated balance sheet. 
Billing occurs either as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon con-
tractual terms, upon achievement of contractual milestones or when the con-
trol of the goods has been transferred to the customer. Atlas Copco sometimes 
receives advances or deposits from customers, before revenue is recognized, 
resulting in contract liabilities. These contract assets and contract liabilities are 
reported in the consolidated balance sheet, in other receivables or other liabili-
ties, on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Pay-
ment terms range from contract to contract and are dependent upon the agree-
ment with the customer. 
Practical expedients
The Group has elected to apply the following expedients:
For the disclosure of the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated 
to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at 
the end of the reporting period, the Group does not disclose the value related to 
the following expedients:
• the performance obligation that is part of the contract that has an original 
expected duration of one year or less, and
• the entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that cor-
responds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance 
completed to date.
For incremental cost of obtaining the contract, the Group uses the practical expe-
dient of recognizing the incremental cost as an expense if the amortization period 
of the asset, that otherwise would have been recognized, is one year or less.
Other operating income and expenses
Commissions received are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the 
financial substance of the agreement. Gains and losses on disposals of an item 
of non-current tangible and intangible assets are determined by comparing the 
proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. See note 7 for additional 
information.
Financial income and expenses
Interest income and interest expenses are recognized in profit or loss using the 
1.
Significant accounting principles, critical accounting estimates and judgements, continued
eﬀective interest method. Dividend income is recognized in profit or loss on the 
date that the Group’s right to receive payment is established. See note 8 for 
additional information.
Income taxes 
Income taxes include both current and deferred taxes. Income taxes are 
reported in profit or loss unless the underlying transaction is reported in other 
comprehensive income or in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is 
reported according to the same principle. 
A current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or 
refundable for the current year or prior years. 
Deferred tax is recognized using the balance sheet liability method. The cal-
culation of deferred taxes is based on diﬀerences between the values reported 
in the balance sheet and their valuation for taxation, which are referred to as 
temporary diﬀerences, and the carry forward of unused tax losses and tax cred-
its. Temporary diﬀerences attributable to the following assets and liabilities are 
not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition (other 
than in business combinations) of assets or liabilities that aﬀect neither account-
ing nor taxable profit, and diﬀerences related to investments in subsidiaries, 
associated companies and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably 
not reverse in the foreseeable future, and for which the Company is able to con-
trol the timing of the reversal of the temporary diﬀerences.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized. In 
the calculation of deferred taxes, enacted or substantively enacted tax rates are 
used for the individual tax jurisdictions. 
Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are oﬀset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to set oﬀ current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the 
Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. For 
details regarding taxes, see note 9.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated based on the profit for the year attribut-
able to owners of the parent and the basic weighted average number of shares 
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are calculated based on the profit for 
the year attributable to owners of the parent and the diluted weighted average 
number of shares outstanding. Dilutive eﬀects arise from stock options that are 
settled in shares, or that at the employees’ choice can be settled in shares or cash 
in the share-based incentive programs. 
Stock options have a dilutive eﬀect when the average share price during the 
period exceeds the exercise price of the options. When calculating the dilutive 
eﬀect, the exercise price is adjusted by the value of future services related to the 
options. If options for which employees can choose settlement in shares or cash 
are dilutive, the profit for the year is adjusted for the diﬀerence between cash-
settled and equity-settled treatment of options and the more dilutive of cash 
settlement and share settlement is used in calculating earnings per share. See 
note 11 for more details.
Intangible assets
Goodwill 
Goodwill is recognized at cost, as established at the date of acquisition of a busi-
ness (see “Business combinations”), less accumulated impairment losses, if any. 
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units (CGU) that are expected to 
benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Impairment testing is 
made at least annually or whenever the need is indicated. The impairment test is 
performed at the level on which goodwill is monitored for internal manage-
ment purposes. The four business areas of Atlas Copco’s operations have been 
identified as CGUs. Goodwill is reported as an indefinite useful life intangible 
asset. 
Technology-based intangible assets
Expenditure on research activities is expensed as incurred. Research projects 
acquired as part of business combinations are initially recognized at their fair 
value at the acquisition date. Subsequent to initial recognition, these research 
projects are carried at cost less amortization and impairment losses. Expendi-
ture on development activities are expensed as incurred unless the activities 
meet the criteria for being capitalized i.e.: 
• the product or process being developed is estimated to be technically and 
commercially feasible, and 
• the Group has the intent and ability to complete and sell or use the product  
or process. 
The expenditure capitalized includes the cost of materials, direct labor, and 
other costs directly attributable to the project. Capitalized development expen-
diture is carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses.

amounted to 792 (734). This has been reported as part of research and develop-
ment costs in the income statement since the Group follows up on the research 
and development function as a whole.
Trademarks
Trademarks acquired by the Group are capitalized based on their fair value at 
the time of acquisition. Certain trademarks are estimated to have an indefinite 
useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. They are 
tested at least annually for impairment. Other trademarks, which have finite 
useful lives, are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment 
losses.
Marketing and customer related intangible assets
Acquired marketing and customer related intangibles are capitalized based on 
their fair value at the time of acquisition and are carried at cost less accumulated 
amortization and impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets relating to contract-based rights, such as licenses or 
franchise agreements, are capitalized based on their fair value at the time of 
acquisition and carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment 
losses. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill, trademarks and similar 
items is expensed as incurred. Changes in the Group’s intangible assets during 
the year are described in note 12.
Property, plant and equipment 
Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses. Cost of an item of property, plant and 
equipment comprises purchase price, import duties, and any cost directly attrib-
utable to bringing the asset to the location and condition for use. The cost also 
includes dismantlement and removal of the asset in the future if applicable. Bor-
rowing cost for assets that need a substantial period of time to get ready for 
their intended use are included in the cost value until the assets are substantially 
ready for their use or sale and are thereafter depreciated over the useful life of 
the asset. The Group capitalizes costs on initial recognition and on replacement 
of significant parts of property, plant and equipment if it is probable that the 
future economic benefits embodied will flow to the Group and the cost can be 
measured reliably. All other costs are recognized as an expense in profit or loss 
when incurred.
Rental equipment
The rental fleet is comprised of diesel and electric powered air compressors, 
generators, air dryers, and to a lesser extent general construction equipment. 
Rental equipment is initially recognized at cost and is depreciated over the esti-
mated useful lives of the equipment. Rental equipment is depreciated to a resid-
ual value estimated at 0–10% of cost.
Depreciation and amortization 
Depreciation and amortization are calculated based on cost using the straight-
line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Parts of property, plant 
and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total cost of the 
item are depreciated separately when the useful lives of the parts do not coin-
cide with the useful lives of other parts of the item. The following useful lives are 
used for depreciation and amortization: 
Technology-based intangible assets
3–15 years
Trademarks with finite lives
5–15 years 
Marketing and customer related intangible assets
5–15 years
Buildings
25–50 years
Machinery and equipment
3–10 years
Vehicles
4–5 years
Computer hardware and software
3–10 years
Rental equipment
3–8 years
The useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Land, assets under con-
struction, goodwill, and trademarks with indefinite lives are not depreciated or 
amortized. For changes in the Group’s property, plant and equipment see note 13.
Lease – IFRS 16 
Transition method
The Group applies the new standard, IFRS 16, from January 1, 2019. The new 
standard replaces IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrange-
ment contains a Lease. The Group has performed the transition by using the 
modified retrospective approach, which does not require restatement of  
comparative periods. The comparative information continues to be reported  
in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The accounting principles for the com-
1.
Significant accounting principles, critical accounting estimates and judgements, continued
parative figures are presented below under the heading “Lease – IAS 17  
(comparative figures), page 70. Details of the changes in accounting policies 
are presented below.
Atlas Copco’s lease portfolio consists mainly of leased buildings such as  
oﬃce and warehouse premises, vehicles and production equipment.
Group as a lessee
As a lessee, the Group has elected to apply a number of practical expedients. 
Recognition exemptions are set per asset category for short-term leases and 
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. Leases that, at the com-
mencement date, had a lease term of 12 months or less are not recognized as 
leases in the balance sheet. The Group has elected to apply the exemption for 
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value regarding oﬃce equipment 
such as printers and computers. 
All finance leases are excluded at transition as well as leases where the lease 
term ends prior to January 1, 2020. For short-term leases and leases where the 
underlying asset are of low value, the Group recognized lease payments as an 
expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Non-lease components such as service components and other variable com-
ponents that do not depend on an index or price are accounted for as expenses, 
if they could be separated in the contracts for the leased asset. In most cases  
service components are variable and based on for example consumption.
For leases of other assets, previously classified as operating leases under IAS 
17, the Group recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
Leases previously classified as finance leases
Leases that were classified as finance leases under IAS 17 were determined at 
the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and lease liability at January 1, 
2019. 
Group as a lessor
Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from the accounting under IAS 17, 
except for sub-lease contracts. Under IFRS 16, sub-lease contracts that were pre-
viously classified as an operating lease is required to be assessed with reference 
to the right-of-use asset instead of the underlying asset.
Impacts on financial statements 
At transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognized an additional 3 259 MSEK of right-
of-use assets and 3 284 MSEK of lease liabilities. The diﬀerence between right-
of-use assets and lease liabilities refers to prepaid or accrued lease payments 
and financial lease receivables on agreements from subleasing. 
The Group discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate 
at January 1, 2019, the weighted-average rate for the Group was 2.2% at transi-
tion. Incremental borrowing rates are set per country and maturity.

ties had a small negative impact on net financial items.

from financing activities decreased with a corresponding increase in cash flow 
from operating activities. The interest portion of the lease payment remains as 
cash flow from operating activities and is included in net financial items paid.
Group as lessee
Recognition of a lease
Upon initiation, contracts are assessed by the Group, to determine whether a 
contract is, or contains a lease. If the contract conveys the right to control the use 
of an identified asset for a certain period of time in exchange for consideration, 
then it is or contains a lease. The right to control the use of an identifiable asset is 
assessed by the Group based upon if there is an identifiable asset, if the Group 
has the right to obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of the 
asset and if the Group has the right to steer the use of the asset. The policy is 
applied to contracts entered into, or changed, on or after January 1, 2019. The 
Group has elected to separate the non-lease components and also elected to 
apply a number of practical expedients with regard to short-term leases and 
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. In cases where the Group 
acts as an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head-lease and 
the sub-lease separately.
Measurement of a right-of-use asset and lease liability
Right-of-use asset
On commencement date, the Group measures the right-of-use asset at cost, 
which includes the following: the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for 
any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease 
incentives received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Group as well as 
an estimate of costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing 
the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the 
underlying asset to the condition required by the lease contract. Cost for dis-
mantling, removing or restoring the site on which it is located and or the under-
lying asset is only recognized when the Group incurs an obligation to do so.
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term, using the straight-
line method.  
Lease liability
On commencement date, the lease liability is measured at the present value of 
the unpaid lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the 
lease, or if the rate cannot be readily determined, the Group’s incremental bor-
rowing rate. Lease payments included in the lease liability comprise of fixed pay-
ments, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts to 
be paid under a residual value guarantee and lease payments in an optional 
renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option 
as well as penalties for early termination of a lease, if the Group is reasonably 
certain to terminate early. If there is a purchase option present, this will be 
included if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the option. 
The lease liability is measured at amortized cost by using the eﬀective interest 
rate method.
Short-term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value
The Group has elected to apply recognition exemptions for short-term leases 
and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, for example oﬃce 
equipment such as printers and computers. Lease payments associated with 
those leases are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease 
term. 
Group as a lessor
At inception of a lease contract, the Group assess whether the lease is a finance 
lease or an operating lease. If the lease transfers substantially all of the risks and 
rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, it is considered to be a finance 
lease; if not, it is an operating lease. Under finance leases where the Group acts 
as lessor, the transaction is recognized as a sale and a lease receivable, compris-
ing the future minimum lease payments and any residual value guaranteed to 
the Group. Lease payments are recognized as repayment of the lease receivable 
and interest income. In cases where the Group acts as a lessor under an operat-
ing lease, the lease payments are included in profit or loss on a straight-line basis 
over the term of the lease. 
In cases where the Group acts as an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its 
interests in the head-lease and the sub-lease separately. The Group assesses the 
lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising 
from the head-lease. 
Lease – IAS 17 (comparative figures)
The Group acts both as lessor and lessee. Leases are classified as either finance 
leases or operating leases. A finance lease entails the transfer to the lessee of 
substantially all of the economic risks and benefits associated with ownership. If 
this is not the case, the lease is accounted for as an operating lease.
1.
Significant accounting principles, critical accounting estimates and judgements, continued
Group as lessee
For the Group, a financial lease implies that the fixed asset leased is recognized 
as an asset in the balance sheet. Initially, a corresponding liability is recorded. 
Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the 
lower of its fair value and the present value of the future minimum lease pay-
ments. Fixed assets under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated 
useful lives, while the lease payments are reported as interest and amortization 
of the lease liability. For operating leases, the Group does not account for the 
leased asset in its balance sheet. The costs of operating leases are recorded in 
the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Group as lessor
In cases where the Group acts as the lessor under an operating lease, the asset is 
classified as rental equipment and is subject to the Group’s depreciation poli-
cies. The lease payments are included in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over 
the term of the lease. Under finance leases where the Group acts as lessor, the 
transaction is recorded as a sale and a lease receivable, comprising the future 
minimum lease payments and any residual value guaranteed to the Group. 
Lease payments are recognized as interest income and repayment of the lease 
receivable. See note 22 for more details on leases.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying values of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at least at 
each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impair-
ment. If any such indication exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the asset. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an asset 
or its cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the 
greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). In assessing the value in 
use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using 
a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. For the purpose of assessing 
impairment, assets are grouped in CGUs, which are the smallest identifiable 
groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the 
cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. Impairment losses are recog-
nized in profit or loss. An impairment loss related to goodwill is not reversed. In 
respect of other assets, impairment losses in prior periods are reviewed for pos-
sible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realiz-
able value is the estimated selling price for inventories less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories are recognized 
according to the first-in, first-out principle and includes the cost of acquiring 
inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition. Invento-
ries manufactured by the Group and work in progress include an appropriate 
share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity. Inventories 
are reported net of deductions for obsolescence and internal profits arising in 
connection with deliveries from the production companies to the customer cen-
ters. See note 16 for more details.
Equity 
Shares issued by the company are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognized as 
a deduction from equity, net of any tax eﬀect.
When Atlas Copco shares are repurchased, the amount of the consideration 
paid is recognized as a deduction from equity net of any tax eﬀect. Repurchased 
shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from 
total equity. When treasury shares are sold or subsequently reissued, the 
amount received is recognized as an increase in equity and the resulting surplus 
or deficit on the transaction is transferred to or from Other paid-in capital. 
Supply chain financing
The Group and Banks, with close relations to Atlas Copco, oﬀer suppliers the 
opportunity to use a supply chain financing scheme (“SCF”) which allows them 
to be paid earlier than the invoice due date. The Group evaluates supplier 
arrangements against a number of indicators to assess if the payable continues 
to hold characteristics of a trade payable or should be classified as borrowings; 
these indicators include whether the payment terms exceed customary pay-
ment terms in the industry. These transactions has been recognized as either 
“Account payables” or “Borrowings” in the Group’s balance sheet and as 
“Change in operating liabilities” or change in “Borrowings” or “Repayment of 
borrowings” in the statement of cash flows.

Provisions
Provisions are recognized:
•  
when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a  
past event, 
• it is probable that the Group will have to settle the obligation, and 
• the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably. 
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration 
required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. 
If the eﬀect of the time value of money is material, the provision is deter-
mined by discounting the expected future cash flows of estimated expendi-
tures.
Provisions for product warranties are recognized as cost of sales at the time 
the products are sold based on the estimated cost using historical data for level 
of repairs and replacements.
A restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has approved a 
detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either com-
menced or been announced publicly.
Present obligations arising under onerous contracts are recognized as provi-
sions. An onerous contract is considered to exist where the Group has a contract 
under which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the con-
tract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contract. 
Before a provision is established, the Group recognizes any impairment loss on 
the asset associated with the contract. For details on provisions see note 25. 
Post-employment benefits
Post-employment benefit plans are classified either as defined contribution or 
defined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution plan, the Group pays fixed 
contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obli-
gation to pay further amounts if the fund does not hold suﬃcient assets to pay 
all employee benefits. Contributions to defined contributions plans are 
expensed when employees provide services entitling them to the contribution. 
Other post-employment benefit plans are defined benefit plans and it is the 
Group’s obligation to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. 
The net obligation of defined benefit plans is calculated by estimating the 
amount of future benefits that employees have earned in return for their ser-
vices in current and prior periods. The amount is discounted to determine its 
present value and the fair values of any plan assets are deducted. Funded plans 
with net assets, i.e. plans with assets exceeding the commitments, are reported 
as financial non-current assets. 
The cost for defined benefit plans is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit 
Method, which distributes the cost over the employee’s service period. The cal-
culation is performed annually by independent actuaries using actuarial 
assumptions such as employee turnover, mortality, future increase in salaries 
and medical cost. Changes in actuarial assumptions, experience adjustments of 
obligations and changes in fair value of plan assets result in remeasurements 
and are recognized in other comprehensive income. Each quarter a remeasure-
ment is performed to adjust the present value of pension liabilities and the fair 
value of pension assets against other comprehensive income. Net interest on 
defined benefit obligations and plan assets is reported as interest income or 
interest expenses. See note 23 for additional information.
Share-based compensation 
The Group has share-based incentive programs, consisting of share options and 
share appreciation rights, which have been oﬀered to certain employees based 
on position and performance. Additionally, the Board is oﬀered synthetic 
shares. The fair value of share options that can only be settled in shares (equity-
settled) is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in 
equity. The fair value, measured at grant date using the Black-Scholes formula, is 
recognized as an expense over the vesting period. The amount recognized as an 
expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest. The 
fair value of the share appreciation rights, synthetic shares, and options with a 
choice for employees to settle in shares or cash is recognized in accordance with 
principles for cash-settled share-based payments. The value is recognized as an 
employee expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value, 
measured at grant date and remeasured at each reporting date using the Black-
Scholes formula, is accrued and recognized as an expense over the vesting 
period. Changes in fair value are, during the vesting period and after the vesting 
period until settlement, recognized in profit or loss as an employee expense. 
The accumulated expense recognized equals the cash amount paid at settle-
ment. 
Social security charges are paid in cash and are accounted for in consistence 
with the principles for cash-settled share-based payments, regardless of 
whether they are related to equity- or cash-settled share-based payments. See 
note 23 for details.

a) Classification and valuation  
All financial assets that were valued to fair value continue to be valued to fair 
value. Investments in certain debt instruments prior recognized at amortized 
cost are recognized at fair value through profit or loss. Investments in liquidity 
funds are valued to fair value through profit or loss. The Group has made the 
judgement that account receivables fulfill the criteria to be valued at amortized 
cost. 
b) Impairment
The Group applies the simplified method for accounting of expected losses 
related to trade receivables and lease receivables, contract assets and certain 
other financial receivables.
c) Hedge accounting 
The Group determined that all existing hedge relationships that were desig-
nated as eﬀective hedging relationships will continue to qualify for hedge 
accounting under IFRS 9. 
Recognition and derecognition
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provision of the instrument. Transactions of financial assets 
are accounted for at trade date, which is the day when the Group contractually 
commits to acquire or dispose of the assets. Trade receivables are recognized on 
issuance of invoices. Liabilities are recognized when the other party has per-
formed and there is a contractual obligation to pay. Derecognition, fully or par-
tially, of a financial asset occurs when the rights in the contract have been real-
ized or mature, or when the Group no longer has control over it. A financial lia-
bility is derecognized, fully or partially, when the obligation specified in the con-
tract is discharged or otherwise expires. A financial asset and a financial liability 
are oﬀset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when there is a 
legal right to oﬀset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to either 
settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Gains and losses from derecognition and modifications are recognized in 
profit or loss. 
Measurement of financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified at initial recognition. The classification 
decides the measurement of the instruments. 
Classification and measurement of financial assets
Equity instruments: are classified at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Derivative instruments: are classified at FVTPL, unless they are classified as a 
hedging instrument and the eﬀective part of the hedge is recognized in other 
comprehensive income.
Debt instruments: the classification of financial assets that are debt instruments, 
including hybrid contracts, is based on the Group’s business model for manag-
ing the assets and the asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics. The instru-
ments are classified at:
• amortized cost,
• fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), or
• fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Financial assets at amortized cost are at initial recognition measured at fair value 
including transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are measured at the 
eﬀective interest rate method. Assets classified at amortized cost are held under 
the business model of collecting the contractual cash flows that are solely pay-
ments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The assets 
are subject to a loss allowance for expected credit losses.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP
72
Atlas Copco 2019
Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are assets held under 
the business model of both selling and collecting the contractual cash flows that 
are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstand-
ing. Financial instruments in this category are recognized at fair value at initial 
recognition and changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive 
income (OCI) until derecognition, when the amounts in OCI are reclassified to 
profit or loss. The assets are subject to a loss allowance for expected credit 
losses.
Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) are all other debt instruments that 
are not measured at amortized cost or FVOCI. Financial instruments in this cate-
gory are recognized at fair value at initial recognition and changes in fair value 
are recognized in profit or loss.
Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified at amortized cost, except derivatives. Financial 
liabilities at amortized cost are at initial recognition measured at fair value 
including transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are measured at the 
eﬀective interest rate method. 
Derivatives are classified at FVTPL, unless they are classified as a hedging 
instrument and the eﬀective part of the hedge is recognized in other compre-
hensive income.
Fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities is determined in the  
manner described in note 27.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, except those classified at fair value through profit and loss 
(FVTPL), are subject to impairment for expected credit losses. In addition, the 
impairment model applies to contract assets, loan commitments and financial 
guarantees that are not measured at FVTPL. The IFRS 9 expected credit loss 
(ECL) model is forward looking and a loss allowance is recognized when there is 
an exposure to credit risk, usually at first recognition of an asset or receivable. 
The ECL reflects the present value of all cash shortfalls related to default events 
either over the following 12 months or over the expected life of a financial 
instrument, depending on the type of asset and on the credit deterioration from 
inception. The ECL reflects an unbiased, probability-weighted outcome that 
considers multiple scenarios based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
The simplified model is applied on trade receivables, lease receivables, con-
tract assets and certain other financial receivables. A loss allowance is recog-
nized over the expected lifetime of the receivable or asset. For other items sub-
ject to ECL, the impairment model with a three-stage approach is applied. Ini-
tially, and at each reporting date, a loss allowance will be recognized for the fol-
lowing 12 months, or a shorter time period depending on the time to maturity 
(stage 1). If it has been a significant increase in credit risk since origination, a loss 
allowance will be recognized for the remaining lifetime of the asset (stage 2). 
For assets that are considered as credit impaired, allowance for credit losses will 
continue to capture the lifetime expected credit losses (stage 3). For credit 
impaired receivables and assets, the interest revenue is calculated based on the 
carrying amount of the asset, net of the loss allowance, rather than its gross car-
rying amount as in previous stages.
In the respective model applied, the measurement of ECL is based on diﬀer-
ent methods for diﬀerent credit risk exposures. For trade receivables, contract 
assets and certain other financial receivables, the method is based on historical 
loss rates in combination with forward looking considerations. Lease receiv-
ables, certain other financial receivables and cash and cash equivalent are 
impaired by a rating method, where ECL is measured by the product of the prob-
ability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default. Both external 
credit agencies rating and internally developed rating methods are applied. 
The measurement of ECL considers potential collaterals and other credit 
enhancements in the form of guarantees.
The financial assets are presented in the financial statements at amortized 
cost, i.e. net of gross carrying amount and the loss allowance. Changes in the 
loss allowance is recognized in profit or loss as impairment losses.
Derivatives and hedge accounting
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date a derivative contract 
is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. The method of rec-
ognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is desig-
nated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item hedged. 
Changes in fair value for derivatives that do not fulfill the criteria for hedge 
accounting are recognized as operating or financial transactions based on the 
purpose of the use of the derivative. Interest payments for interest rate swaps 
are recognized as interest income or expense, whereas changes in fair value of 
future payments are presented as gains or losses from financial instruments. 
IFRS 9 Hedge accounting is applied. In order to qualify for hedge accounting  
the hedging relationship must be:
1.
Significant accounting principles, critical accounting estimates and judgements, continued
• formally identified and designated,
• expected to fulfil the eﬀectiveness requirements, and
• documented.
The Group assesses, evaluates, and documents eﬀectiveness both at hedge 
inception and on an ongoing basis. Hedge eﬀectiveness is assessed by an analy-
sis of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging 
instrument, and the eﬀect of credit risk must not dominate the value changes’ 
that result from that economic relationship. Further, the hedge ratio, as defined 
in the Group´s risk management strategy, must be the same in the hedging rela-
tionship as in the actually hedge performed. 
Cash flow hedges: Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are rec-
ognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is eﬀective 
and the accumulated changes in fair value are recognized as a separate compo-
nent in equity. Gains or losses relating to the ineﬀective part of hedges are rec-
ognized immediately in profit or loss. 
The amount recognized in equity through other comprehensive income is 
reversed to profit or loss in the same period in which the hedged item aﬀects 
profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the rec-
ognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the amount previ-
ously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity is 
transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of 
the non-financial asset or liability. The Group uses foreign currency forwards to 
hedge part of the future cash flows from forecasted transactions in foreign cur-
rencies. Interest rate swaps are also used as cash flow hedges for hedging inter-
est on borrowings with variable interest.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations: The Group hedges a substantial 
part of net investments in foreign operations. Changes in the value of the hedge 
instrument relating to the eﬀective portion of the hedge are recognized in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. Gains or losses relating to 
the ineﬀective portion are recognized immediately in profit or loss. On divest-
ment of foreign operations, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recycled 
through profit or loss, increasing or decreasing the profit or loss on the divest-
ment. The Group uses loans and forward contracts as hedging instruments.
Accounting for discontinuation of hedges: Hedge accounting may not be  
voluntarily discontinued. Hedge accounting is discontinued: 
•  when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, 
•  when there is no longer an economic relationship between the hedged item 
and the hedging instrument or the eﬀect of credit risk dominates the value 
changes that result from the economic relationship, or 
• when the hedge accounting no longer meets the risk management  
objectives. 
For cash flow hedges, any gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity at the time of hedge discontinuation remains 
in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recog-
nized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognized immediately in profit 
or loss. For net investment hedges, any gain and loss recognized in other com-
prehensive income and accumulated in equity at the time of hedge discontinua-
tion remains in equity until divestment of foreign operations, when the gain or 
loss accumulated in equity is recycled through profit or loss. 
Assets held for sale and discontinued operations
Assets are classified as held for sale if their value, within one year, will be recov-
ered through a sale and not through continued use in the operations. On the 
reclassification date, assets and liabilities are measured at the lower of fair value 
less selling expenses and the carrying amount. Gains and losses recognized on 
remeasurements and disposals are reported in profit or loss.  
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that either has been 
disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line 
of business or geographical area of operations. A discontinued operation is 
reported separately from continuing operations in the income statement with 
the corresponding presentation for the comparative period. In the balance 
sheet assets held for sale and associated liabilities are reported separately, the 
comparative period is not aﬀected. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower 
of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Epiroc was distributed during 2018 and has been recognized according to  
the rules concerning discontinued operations (IFRS 5). Epiroc’s profit for the com-
parative period and up to the distribution and the capital gain generated by the 
distribution have been recognized in the line – Profit from discontinued opera-
tions, net of tax. The Group’s cash flows include Epiroc up to the distribution.

Contingent liabilities 
A contingent liability is a possible obligation or a present obligation that arises 
from past events that is not reported as a liability or provision, due either to that 
it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obli-
gation or that a suﬃciently reliable calculation of the amount cannot be made.
New or amended accounting standards in 2019 
In addition to IFRS 16 Leases, the following new or amended IFRS standards 
have been applied by the Group from 2019, with none, or no material impact on 
the Group.
Amendment to IAS 28: Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures 
The amendment clarifies that IFRS 9, including its impairment requirements, 
applies to long-term interests in associates and joint ventures for which the 
equity method is not used. Furthermore, in applying IFRS 9 to long-term inter-
ests in associates and joint ventures, an entity does not take into account adjust-
ments to their carrying amount required by IAS 28 (i.e. adjustments to the carry-
ing amount of long-term interests in associates and joint ventures arising from 
the allocation of losses of the investee or assessment of impairment in accor-
dance with IAS 28). 
Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation
The amendment to IFRS 9 clarifies which financial asset may be measured at 
amortized cost. This amendment permits more assets to be measured at amor-
tized cost than previously allowed, in particular certain pre-payable financial 
assets with negative compensation. To qualify for the amortized cost measure-
ment, the negative compensation must be reasonable compensation for early 
termination of the contract. To be applicable for such handling, the asset must 
be held within a “hold to collect” business model.
 This amendment also clarifies that when there are modifications relating to a 
financial liability measured at amortized cost, which do not lead to derecogni-
tion of the financial liability, a gain or loss should be recognized in the profit and 
loss. This gain or loss is calculated by comparing the initial contractual cash flow 
with the modified cash flow discounted at the original eﬀective interest rate. 
Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement 
The amendment clarifies that the Group must, if a plan amendment, curtail-
ment or settlement occurs, determine the current service cost and the net inter-
est for the period using the assumptions it used for the remeasurement. Fur-
thermore, the amendment clarifies the eﬀect of a plan amendment, curtailment 
or settlement on the requirements regarding the asset ceiling. The amendment 
applies only to plan amendments, curtailments or settlements that occur on or 
after the beginning of the annual period in which the amendments to IAS 19 are 
first applied. 
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments
The interpretation clarifies the application of recognition and measurement 
requirements of IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax 
treatments and is to be applied to the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), 
tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates. 
Annual Improvements 2015–2017 Cycle 
The annual improvements 2015–2017 cycle sets out amendments to four stan-
dards and the related Basis for Conclusion. All the amendments are eﬀective for 
annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 and generally require pro-
spective application. The standard and amendments are as follows:
IFRS 3 – Business Combinations and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 
The amendment to IFRS 3 clarifies that when the Group obtains control over  
the joint operation that is a business, the Group should, according to IFRS 3, 
remeasure the interest previously held in the joint operation to fair value. 
When the Group, that does not have joint control over a joint operation, but 
reaches joint control over the joint operation, that is a business, the Group 
should not, according to IFRS 11, remeasure the interest previously held in that 
joint operation as this does not change the Group’s boundaries.
IAS 12 Income Taxes 
The amendment clarifies that the Group must recognize all income tax conse-
quences of dividends in profit and loss, other comprehensive income or equity, 
depending on the nature and where the entity recognized the originating trans-
action or event.

IAS 23 Borrowing Costs 
The amendment to IAS 23 clarifies that when a qualifying asset is ready for its 
intended use or sale, and some of the specific borrowings related to this asset 
are still outstanding at that point, those outstanding borrowing should be 
included in the funds the company borrows generally and hence be included in 
the borrowing costs used for deciding the capitalization rate.
New or amended accounting standards eﬀective after 2019 
The following standards, interpretations, and amendments have been issued 
but were not eﬀective as of December 31, 2019 and in some cases had not been 
adopted by the EU. The Group has not applied the new standards, interpreta-
tions or amendments. The current assessment is that these amendments will 
have none or no material eﬀect on the Group. 
Amendment to IFRS 3 – Business Combinations
The amendment clarifies the definition of a business. To be considered a busi-
ness, an acquired set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an 
input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the 
ability to create outputs. Also the definition of the term “outputs” is amended to 
focus on goods and services provided to customers, generating investment 
income and other income, and it excludes returns in the form of lower costs and 
other economic benefits. The amendments are applied prospectively to all busi-
ness combinations and asset acquisitions for which the acquisition date is on 
January 1, 2020 or after, with early application permitted.
Amendment to IAS 1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material 
The amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors are done to 
align the definition of “material” across the standards and to clarify certain 
aspects of the definition. The new definition states that, “Information is material 
if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence 
the decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements 
make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial infor-
mation about a specific reporting entity.” In particular, the amendment clarifies 
the concept of “obscuring” material information and the meaning of primary 
users of general purpose financial statements. Furthermore, IASB also amended 
other Standards and the Conceptual Framework that contain a definition of 
material or refer to the term “material” to ensure consistency. The amendments 
are applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2020 or 
after, with earlier application permitted. 
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform (Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IAS 39)
There is an ongoing project to reform interest rate benchmarks, such as EONIA, 
EURIBOR and LIBOR, and alternative reference rates, known as “risk-free 
rates”(RFR’s) are being developed and will replace existing interest rate bench-
marks. In this process IASB has issued amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9 and IAS 39 
that deals with hedging relationships that are directly aﬀected by the interest 
rate benchmark reform and provide temporary exceptions from applying spe-
cific hedge accounting requirements during the period of uncertainty arising 
from the reform. The amendments are applied for annual periods beginning on 
January 1, 2020 or after, with earlier application permitted.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
The preparation of financial reports requires management’s judgement and the 
use of estimates and assumptions that aﬀects the amounts reported in the con-
solidated financial statements. These estimates and associated assumptions are 
based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be 
reasonable under the prevailing circumstances. Actual result may diﬀer from 
those estimates. The estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an on-going 
basis. Changes in accounting estimates are recognized in the period which they 
are revised in and in any future periods aﬀected.
The estimates and the judgements which, in the opinion of management, are 
significant to the underlying amounts included in the financial reports and for 
which there is a significant risk that future events or new information could 
entail a change in those estimates or judgements are as follows:
Revenue recognition
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Revenue for services and for highly customized goods where an enforceable 
right of payment is present is recognized over time in profit or loss by reference 
to the progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligation at the bal-
ance sheet date. The progress towards satisfaction is determined by the propor-
tion of cost incurred to date compared to the estimated total cost of each per-
formance obligation. There is always an uncertainty if the total estimated 
expenditure is correctly calculated, and if the expenditure incurred reflects 
accurately the actual costs incurred, which means that there is uncertainty in the 
estimates of the degree of completion of the work performed. Management 
has assessed this method of determining the progress towards satisfaction of 
the performance obligation as most suitable as it reflects the progression of 
work performed, and the enforceable right of payment from the customer as 
the costs are incurred on the performance obligations. 
Revenue for goods sold is recognized in profit or loss at one point in time 
when control of the good has been transferred to the customer. 
Accounting judgement
Management’s judgement is used, for instance, when assessing:
• the degree of progress towards satisfaction of the performance obligations 
and the estimated total costs for such contracts when revenue is recognized 
over time, to determine the revenue and cost to be recognized in the current 
period, and whether any losses need to be recognized, 
• if the control has been transferred to the customer (for example the Group has 
a present right to payment for the good, the customer has legal title of the 
good, the good has been delivered to the customer and or the customer has 
the significant risks and rewards of the ownership of the good), to determine 
if revenue and cost should be recognized in the current period,
• the transaction price of each performance obligation when a contract 
includes more than one performance obligation, to determine the revenue 
and cost to be recognized in the current period,
• certain contracts which include a right of return and or volume rebates that 
give rise to variable consideration, variable consideration is assessed to iden-
tify possible constrains, and
• the customer credit risk (i.e. the risk that the customer will not meet the  
payment obligation), to determine and justify the revenue recognized in the 
current period. 
Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets and other  
long-lived assets
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Goodwill and certain trademarks are not amortized but are subject to annual 
tests for impairment. Other intangible assets and other long-lived assets are 
amortized or depreciated based on management’s estimates of the period that 
the assets will generate revenue but are also reviewed regularly for indications 
of impairment. The impairment tests are based on a review of the recoverable 
amount, which is estimated based on management’s projections of future cash 
flows using internal business plans and forecasts. 
Accounting judgement
Asset impairment requires management’s judgement, particularly in assessing: 
•  whether an event has occurred that may aﬀect asset values, 
• whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the net present 
value of future cash flows, which are estimated based upon the continued use 
of the asset in the business,  
• the appropriate assumptions to be applied in preparing cash flow projections, 
and
• the discounting of these cash flows.
Changing the assumptions selected by management to determine the level, if 
any, of impairment could aﬀect the financial position and results of operation. 
See note 12.
Deferred taxes
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary diﬀerences between the car-
rying amounts for financial reporting purposes of assets and liabilities and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes and for tax loss carry-forwards. The Group 
records deferred tax assets based upon management’s estimates of future tax-
able profit in diﬀerent tax jurisdictions. The actual results may diﬀer from these 
estimates, due to change in the business climate and change in tax legislation. 
See note 9.
Inventory
Accounting judgement
The Group values inventory at the lower of historical cost, based on the first-in, 
first-out basis, and net realizable value. The calculation of net realizable value 
involves management’s judgement on the estimated sales prices, over-stock 
articles, outdated articles, damaged goods, and selling costs. If the estimated 
net realizable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance is established for 
inventory obsolescence. See note 16 for additional information.
Leases 
Accounting judgement 
The Group has several lease contracts that include extension options. The Group 
applies judgement in evaluating the lease term, it considers all facts and circum-
stances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option. 
Extension options are only included in the lease term if the lease is reasonably 
certain to be extended. For leases of premises, the following factors are nor-
mally the most relevant:
• If any leasehold improvements are expected to have a significant remaining 
value, the Group is typically reasonably certain to extend.
• Otherwise, the Group considers other factors including historical lease dura-
tions and the costs and business disruption required to replace the leased 
asset.
The renewal periods for leases of oﬃces and warehouse premises with exten-
sion options exceeding 10 to 15 years are not included as part of the lease term 
as these are not reasonably certain to be exercised. In addition, renewal options 
for leases of motor vehicles are not part of the lease term because the Group 
typically leases motor vehicles for not more than three to five years and, hence, is 
not exercising any renewal options. 
 After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is 
a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and 
aﬀects its ability to exercise the option to renew. Refer to note 22 for informa-
tion on potential future rental payments relating to extension options that are 
not included in the lease term. 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty: 
When the Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, 
it uses incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is 
the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow over similar 
terms which requires estimations when no observable rates are available. The 
Group estimates the IBR by using market interest rates and adjusting with entity 
specific estimates such as currency and country risk.

Trade and financial receivable 
Key sources of estimation uncertainty: 
The Group measure the expected credit losses on financial assets classified at 
amortized cost including trade and financial receivables, lease receivables and 
contract assets. The expected credit losses for trade receivables and contract 
assets are an assessment of specific loss provisions corresponding to individually 
significant exposures as well as historical loss rates in combination with forward 
looking considerations. The expected credit losses for lease receivables and 
financial receivables are an assessment that reflects an unbiased, probability-
weighted outcome based on reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
Accounting judgement:  
Management’s judgement considers rapidly changing market conditions. An 
overlay control is performed to ensure that an adequate loss allowance is recog-
nized. Additional information is included in section “Credit risk” in note 27.  
Pension and other post-employment benefit valuation assumptions
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Pensions and other post-employment obligations are dependent on the 
assumptions established by management and used by actuaries in calculating 
such amounts. The key assumptions include discount rates, inflation, future  
salary increases, mortality rates, and healthcare-cost trend rates. The actuarial 
assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis and are changed when it is 
deemed appropriate. 
See note 23 for additional information regarding assumptions used in the 
calculation of pension and post-employment obligations. 
Legal proceedings and tax claims
Accounting judgement 
Atlas Copco recognizes a liability when the Group has an obligation from a past 
event involving the transfer of economic benefits and when a reasonable esti-
mate can be made of what the transfer might be. The Group reviews outstand-
ing legal cases regularly in order to assess the need for provisions in the financial 
statements. These reviews consider the factors of the specific case by internal 
legal counsel and through the use of outside legal counsel and advisors when 
necessary. The financial statements may be aﬀected to the extent that manage-
ment’s assessments of the factors considered are not consistent with the actual 
outcome.
Additionally, the legal entities of the Group are frequently subject to audits 
by tax authorities in accordance with standard practice in the countries where 
the Group operates. In instances where the tax authorities have a diﬀerent view 
on how to interpret the tax legislation, the Group makes estimates as to the like-
lihood of the outcome of the dispute, as well as estimates of potential claims. 
The actual results may diﬀer from these estimates.
Warranty provisions
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Provisions for product warranties should cover future commitments for the 
sales volumes already realized. Warranty provisions are complex accounting 
estimates due to the variety of variables which are included in the calculations. 
The calculation methods are based on the type of products sold and historical 
data for level of repairs and replacements. The underlying estimates for  
calculating the provision are reviewed at least quarterly as well as when new 
products are introduced or when other changes occur which may aﬀect the  
calculation. See note 25.

Assets held for sale and divestments
In 2019, there have been no divestments. On February 2, 2018, Atlas Copco’s 
concrete and compaction business, part of the Power Technique business area, 
was divested to Husqvarna. Some other minor divestments were also made dur-
ing the year. Net cash eﬀect of these divestments was 404. The divestments 
resulted in a capital gain of 134 and a result from recycling of accumulated his-
torical translation diﬀerences to the income statement of 12. These items are 
reported under “Other operating income”. See note 7. None of these divest-
ments met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations, and are 
hence not included in the discontinued operations below.

Discontinued operations
At the Annual General Meeting on April 24, 2018, it was decided to split the 
Group and distribute the shares of Epiroc AB to the shareholders of Atlas Copco. 
In June, the shareholders received one Epiroc share for each Atlas Copco share. 
Epiroc AB was listed on Nasdaq Stockholm on June 18, 2018 and the final prices 
paid that day were SEK 90.85 per Series A share and SEK 85.80 per Series B share, 
resulting in a market capitalization of MSEK 108 299. On the distribution of the 
Epiroc shares, Atlas Copco recognized a capital gain in discontinued operations 
of MSEK 87 105 representing the diﬀerence between the fair value of Epiroc and 
the carrying value of the net assets of the discontinued operations at the time of 
the distribution. As part of the distribution, all historical translation diﬀerences 
allocated to Epiroc, amounting to MSEK 934, were recycled to the income state-
ment for discontinued operations. 
Discontinued operations below also include the eﬀect of the final settlement 
in 2018 of the divestment of Atlas Copco’s Road Construction Equipment divi-
sion that took place in October 2017.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ATLAS COPCO GROUP
82
Atlas Copco 2019
The Group is organized in separate and focused but still integrated business 
areas, each operating through divisions. The business areas oﬀer diﬀerent prod-
ucts and services to diﬀerent customer groups. They are also the basis for man-
agement and internal reporting and are regularly reviewed by the Group’s Presi-
dent and CEO, the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision 
maker uses more than one measure of the operating segments’ profit or loss to 
assess performance and allocate resources. The operating profit of the business 
areas is the primary profit measure used by the chief operating decision maker, 
and is reconciled to the consolidated operating profit in the tables on the previ-
ous pages. Items aﬀecting comparability are included in a separate table since 
the chief operating decision maker review also these as part of allocating 
resources to the diﬀerent business areas. All business areas are managed on  
a worldwide basis and their role is to develop, implement and follow up the 
objectives and strategies within their respective business.  
See pages 20–33 for a description of the business areas. 
Common group functions, i.e. functions which serve all business areas or the 
Group as a whole, are not considered a segment.
The accounting principles for the segments are the same as those described 
in note 1. Atlas Copco’s inter-segment pricing is determined on a commercial 
basis.
Segment assets are comprised of property, plant and equipment, right-of-
use assets, intangible assets, other non-current receivables, inventories, and 
current receivables. 
Segment liabilities include the sum of non-interest-bearing liabilities such as 
operating liabilities, other provisions, and other non-current liabilities. Capital 
expenditure includes property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, but 
excludes the eﬀect of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equip-
ment through acquisitions.
Geographical information
The revenues presented are based on the location of the customers while  
non-current assets are based on the geographical location of the assets. These 
assets include non-current assets other than financial instruments, investments 
in associated companies and joint ventures, deferred tax assets, and post-
employment benefit assets.

Remuneration and other fees for members of the Board, the  
President and CEO, and other members of Group Management
Principles for remuneration to the Board and Group Management
The principles for remuneration to the Board and Group Management are 
approved at the Annual General Meeting of the shareholders. The principles 
approved by the 2019 meeting are described in the following paragraphs.
Board members
Remuneration and fees are based on the work performed by the Board. The 
remuneration and fees approved for 2019 are detailed in the table on the previ-
ous page. The remuneration to the President and CEO, who is a member of 
Group Management, is described in the following sections.
The Annual General Meeting decided that each board member can elect to 
receive 50% of the 2019 gross fee before tax, excluding other committee fees, in 
the form of synthetic shares and the remaining part in cash. The number of syn-
thetic shares is based upon an average end price of series A shares during ten 
trading days following the release of the first quarterly interim report for 2019. 
The share rights are earned 25% per quarter as long as the member remains on 
the Board. After five years, the synthetic shares give the right to receive a cash 
payment per synthetic share based upon an average price for series A shares 
during 10 trading days following the release of the first quarterly interim report 
of the year of payment. The board members will receive dividends on series A 
shares until payment date in the form of new synthetic shares. If a board mem-
ber resigns from his or her position before the stipulated payment date as stated 
above, the board member has the right to request a prepayment. The prepay-
ment will be made twelve months after the date when the board member 
resigned or otherwise the original payment date is valid.
Six board members accepted the right to receive synthetic shares.  
The number and costs at grant date and at the end of the financial year are  
disclosed by board member in the table on the previous page.
Group Management
Group Management consists of the President and CEO and eight other mem-
bers of the Executive Committee. The compensation to Group Management 
shall consist of base salary, variable compensation, possible long-term incentive  
(personnel options), pension premium, and other benefits. 
The following describes the various guidelines in determining the amount  
of remuneration:
•  Base salary is determined by position, qualification, and individual  
performance. 
•  Variable compensation is dependent upon how certain quantitative and 
qualitative goals set in advance are achieved. Non-financial parameters have 
for example been in relation to Atlas Copco Business Code of Practice. The 
variable compensation is maximized to 80% of the base salary for the Presi-
dent and CEO, 60% for Business Area Presidents, and 50% for other mem-
bers of Group Management. 
•  Performance related personnel option program for 2019, see note 23.
•  Pension premiums are paid in accordance with a defined contribution  
plan with premiums set in line with Atlas Copco Group Pension Policy for 
Swedish Executives and Atlas Copco terms and conditions for expatriate 
employments.
•  Other benefits consist of company car and medical insurance.
• For the expatriates, certain benefits are paid in compliance with the  
Atlas Copco terms and conditions for expatriate employment. 
A mutual notice of termination of employment of six months shall apply. 
The Board has the right to deviate from the principles stated above if special cir-
cumstances exist in a certain case. No fees are paid to Group Management for 
board memberships in Group companies nor do they receive compensation for 
other duties that they may perform outside the immediate scope of their duties.
President and CEO
The variable compensation can give a maximum of 80 % of the base salary. The 
variable compensation is not included in the basis for pension benefits. Accord-
ing to an agreement, the President and CEO has the option to receive variable 
compensation in the form of cash payment or as a pension contribution. The 
President and CEO is a member of the Atlas Copco Group Pension Policy for 
Swedish Executives, which is a defined contribution plan. The retirement age of 
the President and CEO is set at the age of 65. The contribution is age related and 
is 35% of the base salary. These pension plans are vested. In addition, premiums 
for private health insurance are added.

additional information.
Termination of employment
The President and CEO is entitled to a severance pay of twelve months if the 
Company terminates the employment and a further twelve months if other 
employment is not available. 
Other members of Group Management are entitled to severance pay if the 
Company terminates their employment. The amount of severance pay is depen-
dent on the length of employment with the Company and the age of the execu-
tive, but is never less than 12 months and never more than 24 months’ salary.
Any income that the President and CEO and other members of Group Man-
agement receives from employment or other business activity, whilst severance 
pay is being paid, will reduce the amount of severance pay accordingly. 
Severance pay for the President and CEO and other members of Group Man-
agement is calculated only on the base salary and does not include variable 
compensation. Severance pay cannot be elected by the employee, but will only 
be paid if employment is terminated by the Company.
Remuneration and other committees
In 2019, Hans Stråberg, Chair, Peter Wallenberg Jr and Anders Ullberg were 
members of the remuneration committee. The committee proposed compen-
sation to the President and CEO for approval by the Board. The committee also 
supported the President and CEO in determining the compensation to the other 
members of Group Management. 
Staﬀan Bohman, Chair, Gunilla Berg, Johan Forssell and Hans Stråberg 
formed the Audit Committee.
Anders Ullberg, Chair, Staﬀan Bohman and Hans Stråberg parti 
cipated in a 
committee regarding repurchase and sale of Atlas Copco shares.

The eﬀective tax rate was 23.3% (21.6). Withholding and other taxes on divi-
dends of –267 (–343) relate to provisions on retained earnings in countries 
where Atlas Copco incur withholding and other taxes on dividends. Tax-exempt 
income of 697 (665) refers to income that is not subject to taxation or subject to 
reduced taxation under local law in various countries. Adjustments from prior 
years - current tax includes the net from tax issues, tax disputes and also one-
time positive tax eﬀects in diﬀerent countries and amounted to 251 (663).
Previously unrecognized tax losses/credits and deductible temporary diﬀer-
ences, which have been recognized against current tax expense, amounted to 
20 (16). No material unrecognized tax losses/credits or temporary diﬀerence 
have been used to reduce deferred tax expense. 
In 2019, eﬀects of income tax rate changes have aﬀected the result with  
33 (29). 
European Commission’s decision on Belgium’s tax rulings
On January 11, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that  
Belgian tax rulings granted to companies with regard to “Excess Profit” shall be 
considered as illegal state aid and that unpaid taxes shall be reclaimed by the 
Belgian state. Atlas Copco had such tax ruling since 2010.
Following the European Commission decision, Atlas Copco has paid, in total, 
MEUR 313 (MSEK 2 952). In 2015, Atlas Copco made a provision of MEUR 300 
(MSEK 2 802) and paid MEUR 239 (MSEK 2 250) in 2016. In the second quarter of 
2017, Atlas Copco paid the remaining amount of MEUR 68 (MSEK 655). During 
2017, MEUR 13 (MSEK 125) was expensed as an interest cost.
The Belgian government, as well as Atlas Copco, appealed the decision to  
the General Court of the European Union (EGC) in Luxembourg and on February 
14, 2019 the EGC annulled the decision taken by the European Commission on 
January 11, 2016. 
On May 3, 2019, the European Commission appealed the EGC’s annulment. 
On September 16, 2019, the European Commission also announced the decision 
to open 39 separate, in-depth investigations to assess if each specific decision 
granted by Belgium between 2005 and 2014 regarding tax rulings granted to 
multinationals with regard to “Excess Profit” violated the EU rules for state aid. 
One of these 39 separate in-depth investigations concerns Atlas Copco. It is 
likely several years before a final decision is made.

Intangible assets
Impairment tests for cash-generating units with goodwill and  
for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
Impairment tests (including sensitivity analyses) are performed as per  
September 30 each year.  
Current goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes at busi-
ness area level which also represents the Group’s operating segments, the 
goodwill has therefore been tested for impairment at business area level. 
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units have been calculated 
as value-in-use based on management’s five-year forecast for net cash flows 
where the most significant assumptions are revenues, operating profits, work-
ing capital, and capital expenditures.
All assumptions for the five-year forecast are estimated individually for each 
of the business areas based on their particular market position and the charac-
teristics and development of their end-markets. The forecasts represent man-
agement’s assessment and are based on both external and internal sources.  
The perpetual growth for the period after five years is estimated at 3% (3). 
The Group’s average weighted cost of capital in 2019 was 8% (8) after tax 
(approximately 10.5% (10.5) before tax) and has been used in discounting the 
cash flows to determine the recoverable amounts. The business areas are all rel-
atively diversified and have similar geographical coverage, similar organization 
and structure and, to a large extent, an industrial customer base. Specific risks, if 
any, have aﬀected projected cash flows. The same discount rate has therefore 
been used for all business areas. All business areas are expected to generate a 
return well above the values to be tested, including sensitivity analyses/worst-
case scenarios.

The trade names of Edwards, Leybold, CTI and Polycold in the Vacuum  
Technique business area represent strong trade names that have been used for 
a long time in their industries. Management’s intention is that these trade 
names will be used for an indefinite period of time. Apart from the assessment 
of future customer demand and the profitability of the business, future market-
ing strategy decisions involving the trade names, can aﬀect the carrying value of 
these intangible assets.
Amortization and impairment of intangible assets are recognized in the

Impairment charges on intangible assets totaled 14 (40) of which 0 (2) were clas-
sified as cost of sales in the income statement,14 (26) were classified as research 
and development expenses, 0 (10) were classified as marketing expenses, and 0 
(2) as administrative expenses. Furthermore there was a reversal of impairment 
charges amounting to 0 (32) classified as marketing expenses. Of the impair-
ment charges, 14 (13) were due to capitalized development costs relating to 
projects discontinued. 
Potentially dilutive instruments 
As of December 31, 2019, Atlas Copco had five outstanding employee stock 
option programs. The exercise price including adjustment for remaining vesting 
costs for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 programs exceeded the average share price 
for series A shares, SEK 287.99 per share. These programs are therefore consid-
ered anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per 
share. If the average share price, after adjustment with the above, exceeds the 
strike price in the future, these options will be dilutive.

The 2019 AGM approved a mandate for the Board of Directors to repurchase 
and sell series A shares and series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm in order to fulfill 
the obligations under the performance stock option plan. The mandate is valid 
until the next AGM and allows:
•   
The purchase of not more than 4 250 000 series A shares, whereof a maximum 
4 150 000 may be transferred to personnel stock option holders under the 
performance stock option plan 2019.
•   
The purchase of not more than 70 000 series A shares, later to be sold on the 
market in connection with payment to board members who have opted to 
receive synthetic shares as part of their board fee.
•   
The sale of not more than 30 000 series A shares to cover costs related to  
previously issued synthetic shares to board members.
•   
The sale of maximum 11 000 000 series A and B shares in order to cover the  
obligations under the performance stock option plans 2014, 2015 and 2016.
At the Annual General Meeting on April 24 2018, it was decided to spin-oﬀ and 
distribute the shares of Epiroc AB to the shareholders of Atlas Copco. In June, 
2018, the shareholders received one Epiroc share for each of their Atlas Copco 
shares. Epiroc AB was listed on Nasdaq Stockholm on June 18, 2018. For further 
information see note 3.
 Atlas Copco has generated significant cash flows in recent years, resulting in a 
strong financial position. To adjust the Group’s capital structure without jeopar-
dizing the capacity to finance further growth, the 2018 Annual General Meeting 
approved a redemption procedure and the following transactions were
performed in 2018:
•   
Split of each series A and series B shares into one ordinary share and one 
redemption share.
•   
Reduction of the share capital for repayment to the shareholders by way  
of redemption of 1 229 613 104 redemption shares at SEK 8 per share. This  
corresponded to a total distribution of SEK 9 704 644 888 to the shareholders 
taking into account that 16 532 409 shares were held by Atlas Copco and thus 
not eligible for repayment.
•   
Increase of share capital by MSEK 393 by way of a bonus issue whereby the 
Company’s non-restricted equity was used.
The 2018 AGM approved a mandate for the Board of Directors to repurchase 
and sell series A shares and series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm in order to fulfill 
the obligations under the performance stock option plan. The mandate was 
valid until the next AGM and allowed:
•   
The purchase of not more than 3 300 000 series A shares, whereof a maximum 
2 300 000 may be transferred to personnel stock option holders under the 
performance stock option plan 2018.
•   
The purchase of not more than 70 000 series A shares, later to be sold on the 
market in connection with payment to board members who have opted to 
receive synthetic shares as part of their board fee.
•   
The sale of not more than 30 000 series A shares to cover costs related to  
previously issued synthetic shares to board members.
•   
The sale of maximum 6 200 000 series A and B shares in order to cover the  
obligations under the performance stock option plans 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Repurchases and sales are subject to market conditions, regulatory restrictions, 
and the capital structure at any given time. During 2019, 3 000 000 series A 
shares were repurchased while 7 221 962 series A shares and 110 260 series B 
shares were divested in accordance with mandates granted by the 2018 and 
2019 AGM. Further information regarding repurchases and sales in accordance 
with AGM mandates is presented in the table above. The series A shares are held 
for possible delivery under the 2015–2019 personnel stock option programs. 
The series B shares held can be divested over time to cover costs related to the 
personnel stock option programs, including social insurance charges, cash  
settlements or performance of alternative incentive solutions in countries 
where allotment of employee stock options is unsuitable. The total number of 
shares of series A and series B held by Atlas Copco is presented in the table 
above.

Floating interest in the table corresponds to borrowings with fixings shorter or equal  
to six months.
The diﬀerence between carrying value and fair value relates to the measure-
ment method as certain liabilities are reported at amortized cost and not at fair 
value. Changes in interest rates and credit margins create the diﬀerence 
between fair value and amortized cost. See additional information about the 
Group’s exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in note 27. 
In 2019, a MEUR 500 bond matured and was repaid. During the year, Atlas 
Copco AB entered into a 7-year MEUR 300 loan agreement with the European 
Investment Bank. The facility is undrawn. In September, Atlas Copco Finance 
DAC issued a 10-year MEUR 300 bond. 
Lease liabilities increased by MSEK 3 284 on January 1, 2019 due to transition 
from IAS17 to IFRS16. Short term loans include supply chain financing contracts 
with remaining payment terms exceeding 180 days. 
Atlas Copco has a long-term debt rating of A+ (A+) from Standard & Poor’s 
Corporation and A+ (A+) from Fitch Ratings. Other than standard undertakings 
such as negative pledge and pari passu, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and 
committed credit lines are not subject to any financial covenants.

countries in terms of size of plans are Belgium, Germany, Sweden, the United 
Kingdom and the United States. Some plans are funded in advance with certain 
assets or funds held separately from the Group for future benefit payment obli-
gations. Other plans are unfunded and the benefits from those plans are paid by 
the Group as they fall due. 
The plans in Belgium cover early retirement, jubilee, and termination indem-
nity and are all unfunded. 
In Canada, the pension plan and the supplemental retirement pension bene-
fit plan for executives, both funded, were wound up in 2019. There are also two 
unfunded plans, a post-retirement benefit plan and a post-employment plan. 
The plans in Germany cover pensions, early retirements and jubilee. The plans 
are funded. 
There are three defined benefit pension plans in Sweden. The ITP plan is a 
final salary pension plan covering the majority of white-collar employees in 
Sweden. Atlas Copco finances the benefits through a pension foundation. The 
second plan relates to a group of employees earning more than ten income base 
amounts that has opted out from the ITP plan. This plan is insured. The third 
defined benefit pension plan relates to former senior employees now retired. In 
Sweden, in addition to benefits relating to retirement pensions, Atlas Copco has 
obligations for family pensions for many of the Swedish employees, which are 
funded through a third-party insurer, Alecta. This plan is accounted for as a 
defined contribution plan as suﬃcient information for calculating the net pen-
sion obligation is not available. 
In the United Kingdom, there is a final salary pension plan. This plan is 
funded. In 2010, the plan was converted to a defined contribution plan for 
future services. 
The tables below show the Group’s obligations for post-employment benefits and other long-term employee benefits, the assumptions used to determine these  
obligations and the assets relating to these obligations for employee benefits, as well as the amounts recognized in the income statement and the balance sheet.   
The net amount recognized in balance sheet amounted to 3 101 (2 386). The weighted average duration of the obligation is 15.5 (14.5) years.

In the United States, Atlas Copco provides a pension plan, a post-retirement 
medical plan, and a number of supplemental retirement pension benefits for 
executives. The pension plan is funded while the other plans are unfunded.
The Group identifies a number of risks in investments of pension plan assets. 
The main risks are interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity  
and inflation risk, and currency risk. The Group is working on a regular basis to 
handle the risks and has a long-term investment horizon. The investment port-
folio should be diversified, which means that multiple asset classes, markets and 
issuers should be utilized. An asset and liability management assessment should 
be  conducted periodically. The study should include a number of elements. The 
most important elements are the duration of the assets and the timing of liabili-
ties, the expected return of the assets, the expected development of liabilities, 
the forecasted cash flows and the impact of a shift in interest rates on the  
obligation.
The net obligations for post-employment benefits and other long-term 
employee benefits have been recorded in the balance sheet as follows:

The Group has identified discount rate, future salary increases, and mortality as 
the primary actuarial assumptions for determining defined benefit obligations. 
Changes in those actuarial assumptions aﬀect the present value of the net obli-
gation. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the bal-
ance sheet date using, if available, high quality corporate bonds (AAA or AA) 
matching the duration of the pension obligations. In countries where corporate 
bonds are not available, government bonds are used to determine the discount 
rate. In Sweden in line with prior years, mortgage bonds are used for determin-
ing the discount rate. 
Atlas Copco’s mortality assumptions are set by country, based on the most 
recent mortality studies that are available. Where possible, generational mor-
tality assumptions are used, meaning that they include expected improvements 
in life expectancy over time.
The table below shows the sensitivity analysis for discount rate and increase 
in life expectancy and describes the potential eﬀect on the present value of the 
defined pension obligation.

Share value based incentive programs
In 2015–2018, the Annual General Meeting decided on performance-based 
personnel stock option programs based on a proposal from the Board on an 
option program for the respective years. In 2019, the Annual General Meeting 
decided on a performance-based personnel stock option program for 2019  
similar to the 2015–2018 programs. 
Option programs 2015–2019
At the Annual General Meeting 2015–2019 respectively, it was decided to 
implement performance-based personnel stock option programs. The decision 
to grant options was made in April each year and the options were issued in 
March the following year (issue date). The number of options issued for each 
program year depended on the value creation in the Group, measured as Eco-
nomic Value Added (EVA), for the respective program year. For the 2019 option 
program, the number of options varies on a linear basis within a preset EVA 
interval. The size of the plan and the limits of the interval have been established 
by the Board and have been approved by the Annual General Meeting and are 
compatible with the long-term business plan of the Group.
In connection to the issue, the exercise price was calculated as 110% of the 
average trading price for series A shares during a ten-day period following the 
date of the publishing of the fourth quarter report. The options were issued 
without compensation paid by the employee and the options remain the prop-
erty of the employee only to the extent that they are exercisable at the time 
employment is terminated. The 2015 program has a term of five years from the 
grant date whereas the 2016–2019 programs have a term of seven years. The 
options in the 2014–2019 programs are not transferable and become exercis-
able at 100% three years after grant.
The 2015–2019 programs include a requirement for senior executives (31 in 
total) to purchase Atlas Copco A shares for 10% of their gross base salary in 
order to be granted options. A lower amount of investment will reduce the 
number of options proportionately. Further, senior executives who have 
invested in Atlas Copco A shares will have the option to purchase one matching 
share per each share purchased at a price equal to 75% of the average trading 
price for series A shares during a ten-day period following the date of the pub-
lishing of the fourth quarter report. This right applies from three years after 
grant until the expiration of the stock option program. 
The Board had the right to decide to implement an alternative incentive solu-
tion (SARs) for key persons in such countries where the grant of personnel 
options was not feasible. 
In the 2015–2018 programs, the options may, on request by an optionee in 
Sweden, be settled by the Company paying cash equal to the excess of the clos-
ing price of the shares over the exercise price on the exercise day, less any admin-
istrative fees. Due to this choice of settlement by the Swedish employees, these 
options are classified for accounting purposes as cash-settled in accordance 
with IFRS 2.
The Black-Scholes model is used to calculate the fair value of the options/SARs in 
the programs at issue date. For the programs in 2018 and 2019, the fair value of 
the options/SARs was based on the following assumptions:

The expected volatility has been determined by analyzing the historic develop-
ment of the Atlas Copco A share price as well as other shares on the stock  
market.
When determining the expected option life, assumptions have been  
made regarding the expected exercising behavior of diﬀerent categories of 
optionees.

Employee benefits, continued
For SARs and the options classified as cash-settled, the fair value is recognized as 
an expense over the same vesting period; the fair value is, however, remeasured 
at each reporting date and changes in the fair value after the end of the vesting 
period continue to be recognized as a personnel expense.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the expense in 2019 for all share-based incentive 
programs, excluding social costs, amounted to 525 (73) of which 135 (101) refer 
to equity-settled options. The related costs for social security contributions are 
accounted for in accordance with the statement from the Swedish Financial 
Reporting Board (UFR 7) and are classified as personnel expenses.
In the balance sheet, the provision for share appreciation rights and stock 
options classified as cash-settled as of December 31 amounted to 264 (120). 
Atlas Copco shares are held by the Parent Company in order to cover commit-
ments under the programs 2015–2019, see also note 20.

The amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the year have 
been recognized as revenue during the year except for 530 (467). The main  
reason for revenues not recognized during the year is that they are related to 
performance obligations that will be performed in future periods.
 As of end of 2019, transaction price allocated to remaining performance 
obligations was 13 604 (11 283) and the majority will be recognized as revenue 
over the next 3 years. The transaction price does not include consideration that 
is constrained.

Capital management
Atlas Copco defines capital as borrowings and equity, which at December 31 
totaled MSEK 76 945 (62 853). The Group’s policy is to have a capital structure to 
maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to support future devel-
opment of the business. The Board’s ambition is that the annual dividend shall 
correspond to about 50% of earnings per share. In recent years, the Board has 
also proposed, and the Annual General Meeting has approved, distributions of 
“excess” equity to the shareholders through share redemptions and share 
repurchases.
There are no external capital requirements imposed on the Group.

Financial exposure and principles for control of financial risks
Funding and liquidity risk
Funding risk is the risk that the Group does not have access to adequate financ-
ing on acceptable terms at any given point in time. Liquidity risk is the risk that 
the Group does not have access to its funds, when needed, due to poor market 
liquidity.
Policy 
The Group’s policy refers to Atlas Copco AB, Atlas Copco Airpower n.v. and Atlas 
Copco Finance DAC as external borrowings mainly are held in these entities.
•   
The Group should maintain minimum MSEK 8 000 committed credit facilities 
to meet operational, strategic and rating objectives.
•   
The average tenor, time to maturity, of the Group’s external debt shall be at 
least 3 years.
•   
No more than MSEK 8 000 of the Group’s external debt may mature within  
the next 12 months. 
•   
Adequate funding at subsidiary level shall at all times be in place. 
Status at year end
As per December 31, there were no deviations from the Group’s policy.

and available back-up credit facilities from banks. Please refer to note 21 for 
information on utilized borrowings, maturity, and back-up facilities.
The following table shows the maturity structure of the Group’s financial lia-
bilities. The figures shown are contractual undiscounted cash flows based on 
contracted date, when the Group is liable to pay, including both interest and 
nominal amounts. The short-term assets are well matched with the short-term 
liabilities in terms of maturity. Furthermore, the Group has back-up facilities 
with maturity 2021 and 2024 to secure liquidity.

Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is negatively aﬀected by changes  
in the interest rate levels.
Policy
The Group’s policy states that the average duration (i.e. period for which inter-
est rates are fixed) should be a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 48 
months. In January 2020, the Board decided to update the Group’s policy to 
state that the average duration should be a minimum of 6 months and without 
limit. 
Status at year end 
The Group’s borrowings have a mix of fixed and floating rates. No interest rate 
swaps are used to convert interest. For more information about the Group’s  
borrowings, see note 21.

24% (24) of the Group’s bonds and loans have floating interest rates. A shift of 
one percentage point upward of all floating rates would impact the Group’s 
interest net with MSEK –42 (–41). Same shift downwards would impact the 
Group’s interest net with MSEK 0 (10), based on the assumption that the interest 
rate on the Group’s bonds and loans cannot be negative. 
The book value of the Group’s bonds and loans are not exposed to market 
interest rate risk at year end as all bonds and loans are reported at amortized 
cost, compared to if borrowings were reported at fair value where cash flows 
are discounted using market interest rate. 
Currency risk
The Group is present in various geographical markets and undertakes transac-
tions denominated in foreign currencies and is consequently exposed to 
exchange rate fluctuations. The exposure occurs in relation to payments in for-
eign currency (transaction exposure) and when translating foreign subsidiaries’ 
balance sheets and income statements into SEK (translation exposure). 
– Transaction exposure
Transaction exposure risk is the risk that profitability is negatively aﬀected by 
changes in exchange rates, aﬀecting cash flows in foreign currencies in the 
operations. Due to the Group’s global presence, there are inflows and outflows 
in diﬀerent currencies. As a normal part of business, net surpluses or deficits in 
specific currencies emerge. The values of these net positions fluctuate subject to 
changes in currency rates and, thus, render transaction exposure for the Group.  
Policy
The Group’s policy states that exposure shall be reduced by matching in and 
outflows of the same currencies. Business area and divisional management are 
responsible for maintaining readiness to adjust their operations (price and cost) 
to compensate for adverse currency movements. Based on the assumption that 
hedging does not have any significant eﬀect on the Group’s long-term result, 
the policy recommends to leave transaction exposures unhedged on an ongo-
ing basis. In general, business areas and divisions shall not hedge currency risks. 
The Financial Risk Management Committee can decide to hedge part of the 
transaction exposure. Transactions shall then qualify for hedge accounting in 
accordance with IFRS and hedging beyond 18 months is not allowed. Financial 
transaction exposure is fully hedged. 
Status at year end
The Group has continued to manage transaction exposures primarily by match-
ing in- and outflows in the same currencies. Graph 1 shows the net of in- and 
outflows per currency for currencies which have the largest surplus or deficit. 
The operational transaction exposure is defined as the net operational cash 
flow exposure and amounts to MSEK –4 711(–4 670). The estimated amounts 
are based on the Group’s operational external payments from customers and to 
suppliers. 
The transaction exposure sensitivity analysis is based on the operational 
transaction exposure. It shows how the cash flow and profit before tax would 
theoretically be impacted by a five percentage point change in SEK, USD or EUR, 
against all other currencies. The analysis is based on the assumption that no 
hedging transaction has been undertaken and is done before any impact of  
oﬀsetting price adjustments or similar measures.
As an example, the net transaction exposure of in-and outflow payments in EUR 
is a deficit as shown in graph 1. A strengthening in the EUR currency rate against 
all other currencies with +5% would have a negative impact on the cash flow 
and profit before tax of MSEK –438, and a weakening would have a positive 
impact of MSEK 438.

Financial exposure and principles for control of financial risks, continued   
– Translation exposure
Translation exposure risk is the risk that the value of the Group’s net investments 
in foreign currencies is negatively aﬀected by changes in exchange rates. The 
Group’s global presence creates currency eﬀects when subsidiaries’ financial 
statements with functional currencies other than SEK are translated to SEK in 
the Group’s consolidated financial statements. Translation of subsidiaries’ profit 
aﬀects the Group’s profit and balance sheet translation aﬀect other compre-
hensive income. The translation exposure is measured as the net of assets and 
liabilities in a specific currency. 
Policy
The Group’s policy states that translation exposure should be reduced by 
matching assets and liabilities in the same currencies. The Financial Risk Man-
agement Committee can decide to hedge part or all remaining translation 
exposure. Any hedge of translation exposure shall qualify for hedge accounting 
in accordance with IFRS.  
Status at year end
Graph 2 shows the Group’s sensitivity to currency translation eﬀects when  
earnings of foreign subsidiaries are translated to SEK. A five percentage points 
upward change in SEK would impact the Groups’ profit before tax  with
MSEK –1 030 (–935).
The Group has hedged part of the translation exposure using loans and foreign 
exchange forward contracts. The hedges have reduced the exposure on net 
investments in EUR in the consolidated financial statements and the exchange 
rate risk related to net assets in subsidiaries. The hedges are designated as net 
investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements. 
The financial instruments shown in the table below are used to hedge 
EUR-denominated net assets.

In the balance sheet, loans designated as net investment hedges are reported at  
amortized cost and not at fair value. 
Most of the Group´s bonds and loans are designated as net investments hedges, 
and movements in currency rates are accounted for in other comprehensive 
income. A five percentage points upward change in EUR against SEK would 
aﬀect other comprehensive income with MSEK 614 (685) (see also note 1,  
Significant accounting principles, Financial assets and liabilities – financial 
instruments). 
Credit risk
Credit risk can be divided into operational and financial credit risk. These risks 
are described further in the following sections. 
– Operational credit risk
Operational credit risk is the risk that the Group’s customers do not meet their 
payment obligations. 
Policy
The Group’s operational credit risk policy is that business areas, divisions and 
individual business units are responsible for the commercial risks arising from 
their operations. The operational credit risk is measured as the net aggregate 
value of receivables on a customer.
Status at year end 
The table below shows the total credit risk exposure related to assets classified 
as financial instruments as per December 31.

Since the Group’s sales are dispersed among many customers, of whom no  
single customer represents a significant share of the Group’s commercial risk,  
the monitoring of commercial credit risks is primarily done at the business area, 
divisional or business unit level. Each business unit is required to have  
an approved commercial risk policy.
Provision for credit risks
The business units establish provisions for their expected credit losses in respect 
of trade and other receivables. The IFRS 9 expected credit loss (ECL) model is for-
ward looking and a loss allowance is recognized when there is an exposure to 
credit risk. For assets such as trade receivables, lease receivables, contract assets 
and certain other financial receivables, the simplified model is applied. The main 
component of this provision are specific loss provisions corresponding to indi-
vidually significant exposures as well as historical loss rates in combination with 
forward looking considerations. Lease receivables, certain other financial 
receivables and cash and cash equivalents are impaired by a rating method, 
where ECL is measured by the product of the probability of default, loss given 
default, and exposure at default. At year end 2019, the provision for bad debt 
amounted to 3.3% (3.6) of gross total customer receivables. The following table 
presents the gross value of trade receivables, both current and non-current, by 
maturity, together with the related impairment provisions.

The total estimated fair value of collateral for trade receivables amounted to  
44 (59). The collateral mainly consisted of repossession rights and export credit 
insurance. Based on historical default statistics and the diversified customer 
base, the credit risk is assessed to be limited. 
The gross amount of lease receivables amounted to 126 (11), of which 0 (6) 
have been impaired, and the gross amount of other financial receivables 
amounted to 65 (131), of which 8 (1) have been impaired. 
There are no significant amounts past due that have not been impaired. The 
total estimated fair value of collateral for lease receivables and other finance 
receivables was 0 (0) and 0 (0) respectively.
– Financial credit risk
Credit risk on financial transactions is the risk that the Group incurs losses as a 
result of non-payment by counterparts related to the Group’s investments, 
bank deposits or derivative transactions
Policy
The Groups financial credit risk is measured diﬀerently depending on trans-
action type, investment transactions or derivative transactions. 
Investment transactions
Cash and cash equivalent may only be invested with a counterparty if the coun-
terparty rating is above a rating threshold. The threshold for cash and cash 
equivalent is set at A-/A3 (as rated by Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and 
Moody’s). Investments in structured financial products are not allowed, unless 
approved by the Financial Risk Management Committee. Furthermore, counter-
party exposure, tenor and liquidity of the investment are considered before any 
investment is made. A list of each approved counterparty and its maximum 
exposure limit is maintained and monitored.
Derivative transactions
Derivative transactions may only be undertaken with approved counterparts 
for which credit limits are established and with which ISDA (International Swaps 
and Derivatives Association) master agreements and CSA (Credit Support 
Annex) agreements are in force. Derivative transactions may only be entered 
into by Atlas Copco Financial Solutions or in rare cases by another subsidiary, but 
only with approval from the Group Treasurer. Atlas Copco primarily uses deriva-
tives as hedging instruments and the policy allows only standardized (as 
opposed to structured) derivatives.
Status at year end
Investment transactions in form of cash and cash equivalents amounted to 
MSEK 15 005 at year end. These consist of cash, short term bank deposits and 
investments in liquidity funds. At year end, the measured credit risk on deriva-
tives, taking into account the market value and collaterals, amounted to MSEK 
42 (56).

Other market and price risks
Commodity-price risk is the risk that the cost of direct and indirect materials 
could increase as underlying commodity prices rise in global markets. The Group 
is directly and indirectly exposed to raw material price fluctuations. Cost 
increases for raw materials and components often coincide with strong 
end-customer demand and are compensated for by increased market prices. 
Therefore, the Group does not hedge commodity-price risks.
– Fair value of financial instruments
In Atlas Copco’s balance sheet, financial instruments are carried at fair value or 
at amortized cost. The fair value is established according to a fair value hierarchy. 
The hierarchy levels should reflect the extent to which fair value is based on 
observable market data or own assumptions. Below is a description of each level 
and valuation methods used for each financial instrument. 
Level 1
In the Level 1 method, fair value is based on quoted (unadjusted) prices in active 
markets for identical assets or liabilities. A market is considered as active if 
quoted prices from an exchange, broker, industry group, pricing service, or 
supervisory body are readily and regularly available and those prices represent 
actual and regularly occurring market transactions at arm’s length. 
Level 2
In the Level 2 method, fair value is based on models that utilize observable data 
for the asset or liability other than the quoted prices included within Level 1 that 
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly 
(i.e. derived from prices). Such observable data may be market interest rates and 
yield curves. 
Level 3
In the Level 3 method, fair value is based on a valuation model, whereby signifi-
cant input is based on unobservable market data. 
Valuation methods
Derivatives
Fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated based on pre 
vailing 
markets. Interest rate swaps are valued based on market rates and present value 
of future cash flows. Discounted cash flow models are used for the valuation.
Interest-bearing liabilities
Fair values are calculated based on market rates and present value of future  
cash flows.
Finance leases and other financial receivables
Fair values are calculated based on market rates for similar contracts and  
present value of future cash flows.
