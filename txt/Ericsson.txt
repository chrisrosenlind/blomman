Ericsson uses the following operating segments and market areas for financial reporting 
Networks offers multi-technology-capable Radio Access 
Network (RAN) solutions for all network spectrum bands, 
including purpose-built and Open RAN-prepared high-
performance hardware and software  The offerings also 
include a Cloud RAN portfolio, a transport portfolio, pas-
sive and active antenna solutions and a complete service 
portfolio, covering network deployment and support  Business model
Networks is primarily based on a business model where 
Ericsson develops, sells, licenses and delivers hardware, 
software and services  Networks business also includes 
recurring revenue streams such as customer support and 
Cloud Software and Services provides solutions for core 
networks, business and operational support systems, 
network design and optimization, and managed network 
services  Focus is to enable communications service 
providers (CSPs) to succeed in their transition to cloud 
Cloud Software and Services develops, sells, and delivers 
solutions, and operate customer networks  The software 
solutions typically include services for deployment 
projects as well as recurring revenues from software, 
Network Services contracts are typically multi-year 
The segment comprises three business areas offering 
• Enterprise Wireless Solutions, including private wireless networks and wireless WAN (Cradlepoint) 
• Global Communications Platform (Vonage), including 
• Technologies and New Businesses, including mobile 
financial services, security solutions and advertising 
The Enterprise Wireless Solutions portfolio (including 
Cradlepoint) is sold through a term-based subscription 
contract, typically a three-year contract with subsequent 
yearly renewal periods  These subscriptions have up-front 
payments at the beginning of the contract and at each 
Communications Platform is transaction based  In this 
model, Application Service Providers (ASPs) pay a trans-
action fee to Ericsson each time an API is used, while the 
CSPs get paid from Ericsson for providing network capa-
bility/capacity  CSPs also benefit from increased revenues 
from additional traffic going over their network  As the 
market for Network APIs is still being developed, multiple 
Other contracts in segment Enterprise such as UCaaS, 
CCaaS, Private Network etc  are typically as a Service 
(aaS) or license based, with recurring revenue from soft-
ware licenses, services, subscriptions and support 
Segment Other comprises media businesses as well as 
other non-allocated business, including Redbee Media, 
which prepares and distributes live and on-demand video 
services for broadcasters, sports leagues and CSPs  The 
segment also includes other non-allocated business  Business model
Outsourced broadcast service contracts are generally 
multi-year agreements while other media contracts are 
typically aaS or license based with recurring revenue from 
 North East Asia South East Asia, Oceania and India
• South East Asia, Oceania and India Sales in segments Networks and Cloud Software and Services 
are divided into five geographical market areas  Market areas are 
responsible for selling and delivering products and solutions that are 
developed in these business segments, mainly to CSP customers  
In line with our strategy, the market areas have the responsibility to 
ensure that we stay close to our customers while maintaining Group 
The majority of sales in segment Enterprise is reported in market 
area Other  To reach the enterprise market with businesses of all 
sizes, Ericsson has a multi-channel approach, which builds on the 
enterprise channel from Cradlepoint  This is a global program with 
access to tens of thousands of reseller partners in Enterprise Wireless 
In order to provide communication APIs and build a Global Net-
work Platform, the go-to-market model to reach enterprises, ASPs as 
well as developers is crucial  The Global Communications Platform 
(Vonage) has a go-to-market channel with more than 120,000 busi-
IPR licensing revenues from Ericsson’s patents are also reported 
in Market Area Other  Patents are licensed globally on fair, reason-
able, and nondiscriminatory terms (FRAND) to companies that use 
our technology  The key cellular market segments for our patents are 
smartphones, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, consumer electronics 
and automotive  Beyond cellular, other licensed technologies include 
media technologies and other connectivity standards  Ericsson 
licenses its patents bilaterally as well as by participating in patent 
volatility  We will continue to diligently execute

The consolidated financial statements comprise Telefonaktiebolaget LM 
Ericsson, the Parent Company, and its subsidiaries (“the Company”) and 
the Company’s interests in joint ventures and associated companies  The Parent Company is domiciled in Sweden at Torshamnsgatan 21, SE-164 83 Stockholm  Ericsson provides mobile connectivity solutions to 
telecom operators and to enterprise customers in various sectors  
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 
31, 2023, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB), and as endorsed by the EU and RFR 1 “Additional 
rules for Group Accounting,” related interpretations issued by the Swedish 
Financial Reporting Board (Rådet för finansiell rapportering), and the Swedish 
Annual Accounts Act  For the financial reporting of 2023, the Company has 
applied IFRS as issued by the IASB (IFRS effective as per December 31, 2023)  
There is no difference between IFRS effective as per December 31, 2023, and 
IFRS as endorsed by the EU, nor is RFR 1 related interpretations issued by the 
Swedish Financial Reporting Board (Rådet för finansiell rapportering) or the 
Swedish Annual Accounts Act in conflict with IFRS, for all periods presented 
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 
March 5, 2024  The financial statements are subject to approval by the Annual 
Disclosure about new standards and amendments applied as from January 
1, 2023, and the preparations for the adoption of new standards and interpre-
tations not adopted in 2023 are disclosed at the end of this note, see heading 
The financial statements are presented in millions of Swedish Krona (SEK)  
They are prepared on a going concern and historical cost basis, except for 
certain financial assets and liabilities that are stated at fair value: financial 
instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), financial 
instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income 
(FVOCI) and plan assets related to defined benefit pension plans  Financial 
information in the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of cash flows and the 
consolidated statement of changes in equity with related notes are presented 
with two comparison years  For the consolidated balance sheet, financial 
information with related notes is presented with one comparison year 
Basis of consolidation and composition of the Group
Subsidiaries are all companies for which Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, 
directly or indirectly, is the parent  To be classified as a parent, Telefonaktie-
bolaget LM Ericsson, directly or indirectly, must control another company 
which requires that the Parent Company has power over that other company, 
is exposed to variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to use its 
power over that other company  The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control 
The Company is comprised of the parent company, Telefonaktiebolaget 
LM Ericsson, with generally fully-owned subsidiaries in many countries of the 
world  The largest operating subsidiaries are the fully-owned telecom vendor 
companies Ericsson AB, incorporated in Sweden and Ericsson Inc , incorpo-
Items included in the financial statements of each entity of the Company are 
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which 
the entity operates (“the functional currency”)  The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in Swedish Krona (SEK), which is the Parent 
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using 
the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of each respective transaction  For 
practical reason, the Company uses the closing rate of the previous month end 
as approximation of the prevailing rate at the date of transaction, although 
spot rate is used for material one-off transaction where appropriate  
Foreign currency exchange effect is presented as a net item within Financial 
income and expenses, reported separately from other financial income and 
expenses items as this reflects the way the Company manages its foreign 
The results and financial position of all the group entities that have a func-
tional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the 
Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the 
closing rate at the date of that balance sheet  This includes goodwill arising on 
Period income and expenses for each income statement are translated at 
period average exchange rates  For practical reason, the Company uses the 
closing rate of the previous month end as approximation of the period average

The following paragraphs describe the types of contracts, when performance 
obligations are satisfied, and the timing of revenue recognition  They also 
describe the normal payment terms associated with such contracts and the 
resulting impact on the balance sheet over the duration of the contracts  
Products and services are classified as standard solutions as they do not 
require significant installation and integration services to be delivered  
Installation and integration services are generally completed within a short 
period of time, from the delivery of the related products  These products and 
services are viewed as separate distinct performance obligations  This type of 
customer contract is usually signed as a frame agreement and the customer 
issues individual purchase orders to commit to purchases of products and 
For hardware sales, transfer of control and revenue recognition, is usually 
deemed to occur when the equipment arrives at the customer site  
Standard product software is sold as an on-premises software license that 
provides a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the 
customer  Control is transferred when software licenses are provided to the 
customer at a point in time and already activated, or as a released software 
version, ready to be activated by the customer at a later stage  Revenue is 
recognized when control of the software is transferred and unconditional right 
Software licenses are also sold on a when-and-if available basis or delivered 
to the customer network over a period of time  In such cases, the customer is 
billed on a subscription basis, and revenue is recognized over time  For soft-
ware revenue based on usage the revenue is recognized upon usage measure-
ment and right to invoice  Revenue for installation and integration services is 
Revenue for recurring services such as customer support and managed 
services is recognized as the services are delivered, pro-rata over time  
Transaction price for managed services contracts may include variable consid-
eration that is estimated based on performance and prior experience with the 
customer  Contracts for standard products and services apply to all segments  
Enterprise solutions comprise mainly of software platform solutions, delivered 
as-a-service through a cloud delivery model  These are generally sold as sub-
scription contracts with revenue recognized pro-rata over time or on a usage 
Cloud services allow the customer to use hosted software over the contract 
period without taking possession of the software  Cloud services are highly 
integrated with the software and the individual components are not consid-
ered distinct, hence all revenue is recognized in the period these services are 
provided  Contract duration ranges from one month to 5 years  
Revenue for fixed fee arrangement is recognized on a pro-rata basis over 
the contract duration  Revenue for fees based on usage is recognized when 
Services sold through wholesalers or distributors are assessed for principal 
or agent relationship  Wholesalers are treated as agents for services that are 
activated upon delivery of equipment to the end users since the Company 
still has the primary responsibility to the customers for providing the services, 
hence revenue (in the gross amount) is recognized rateably from activation 
This type of contract relates to the patent and licensing business  The 
Company has assessed that the nature of its IPR contracts is such that they 
provide customers a license with the right to access the Company’s intellectual 
properties over time, therefore revenue shall be recognized over the duration of 
the contract  Royalty revenue based on sales or usage is recognized when the 
Trade receivables include amounts that are billed in accordance with customer 
contract terms and amounts that the Company has an unconditional right to, 
with only passage of time before the amounts can be billed in accordance with 
Prices on standard products and services contracts are usually fixed, and 
mostly billed upon delivery of the hardware or software, or completion of 
installation services  A proportion of the transaction price may be billed upon 
formal acceptance of the related installation services, which will result in a 
contract asset for the proportion of the transaction price that is not yet billed  
Amounts billed are normally subject to payments terms within 60 days from 
Standard recurring services contracts are billed over time, often on a quar-
terly basis  Amounts billed are normally subject to payments terms within 60 
days from invoice date  Contract liabilities or receivables may arise depending 
on whether the quarterly billing is in advance or in arrears  
For Enterprise solution fixed fee contracts, billing is typically in advance, 
resulting in contract liability  For usage-based contracts, billing is in arrears, 
resulting in a receivable  Typical credit term is 30 to 45 days  
IPR contracts are usually structured as a royalty fee based on sales or usage 
over the period, measured on a quarterly basis  This results in a receivable 
balance if the billing is performed the following quarter after measurement  
Some contracts include lump sum amounts, payable either upfront at com-
mencement or on an annual basis  This results in a contract liability balance 
if payment is in advance of revenue, as revenue is recognized over time  
Amounts billed are normally subject to payments terms within 60 days from 
Customer finance credits arise from credit terms exceeding 179 days in 
the customer contract or a separate financing agreement signed with the 
customer  Customer finance is a class of financial assets that is managed 
separately from receivables  See note F1 “Financial risk management,” for 
further information on credit risk management of trade receivables and cus-
tomer finance credits  Where financing is provided to the customer, revenue is 
adjusted to reflect the impact of the financing transaction  These transactions 
could arise from the customer finance credits above if the contracted interest 
rate is below the market rate over the duration of the financing period  
The Company has various incremental commission costs for internal sales 
personnel and channel partners that relate to the acquisition of customer 
contracts in the Enterprise segment  These costs are capitalized as deferred 
contract acquisition costs (within Other non-current assets and Other current 
assets) and amortized on a straight-line basis to selling and administrative 
expenses over the contract period  The average contract period is 3 years  
The Company expenses sales commissions for commission plans related to 
customer arrangements with a duration of one year or less  The Company 
periodically assesses for changes in its business or market conditions which 
would indicate that its amortization period shall be changed or if there are 
The segment presentation, as per each segment, is based on the Company’s 
accounting policies as disclosed in this note  An operating segment is a com-
ponent of a company whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the 
Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM), to make decisions about 
resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance  The 
President and the CEO is defined as the CODM function in the Company 
The Company’s segment disclosure about geographical areas is based on 
the country in which transfer of control of products and services occur  For 
further information, see note B1 “Segment information ”
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value and using 
cost formula first-in, first-out (FIFO) related to the Company’s owned produc-
tion and weighted average cost formula for externally purchased components 
within the Company’s production units  The cost of inventories related to work 
Risks of obsolescence have been measured by estimating market value 
based on future customer demand and changes in technology and customer 
acceptance of new products  An inventory obsolescence provision is recog-
nized as cost of sales in the income statement when identified  
In note A2, “Critical accounting estimates and judgments,” further disclosure 
is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the 
decision made in relation to accounting policies applied

As from the acquisition date, goodwill acquired in a business combination is 
allocated to each cash-generating unit (CGU) expected to benefit from the 
An annual impairment test for the CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated is performed in the fourth quarter, or when there is an indication of 
impairment  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of an 
asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount  The recover-
able amount is the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs of 
disposal  In assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows after 
tax are discounted to their present value using an after-tax discount rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset  The after-tax amounts, both in relation to cash flows 
and discount rate, are applied to the calculation because available models for 
calculating the discount rate include a tax component  The effect of after-tax 
discount rates applied by the Company is not materially different from a 
discounting based on before-tax future cash flows and before-tax discount 
rates, as required by IFRS  Write-downs of goodwill are reported under Other 
Additional disclosure is required in relation to goodwill impairment test-
ing: see note A2 “Critical accounting estimates and judgments” and note C1 
Intangible assets other than goodwill comprise intangible assets acquired 
through business combination such as customer relationships, technology 
(patents), and trademarks  In addition, there are capitalized development 
expenses and separately acquired intangible assets, mainly consisting of 
software  At initial recognition, acquired intangible assets relating to busi-
ness combinations are stated at fair value, and capitalized development 
expenses and software are stated at cost  Subsequent to initial recognition, 
these intangible assets are stated at the initially recognized amounts less 
accumulated amortization and any impairment losses  Research and develop-
ment expenses include amortization and impairment losses mainly relating to 
capitalized development expenses and technology  Selling and administrative 
expenses include amortization and impairment losses mainly relating to 
Amortization is charged to the income statement, on a straight-line basis, 
over the estimated useful life of each intangible asset  Estimated useful lives 
for customer relationships acquired through the Vonage acquisition are 6 to 
9 years  For other acquired intangible assets, such as patents, other customer 
relationships, trademarks, and software estimated useful lives do not exceed 
10 years, and capitalized development expenses usually have a useful life of 
Impairment tests are performed when there is an indication of impairment  
Tests are performed in the same way as for goodwill but on an asset level, see 
above  However, intangible assets not yet available for use are tested annually 
In note A2, “Critical accounting estimates and judgments,” further disclosure 
is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the 
decision made in relation to accounting policies applied 
Property, plant, and equipment consist of real estate, machinery and other 
technical assets, other equipment, tools and installations, and construction 
in progress  They are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful life of each component of an item of property, plant, 
and equipment, including buildings  Estimated useful lives are, generally, 
25–50 years for real estate and 3–10 years for machinery and equipment  
Depreciation and any impairment charges are included in Cost of sales, 
Research and development, or Selling and administrative expenses 
Gains and losses on disposals are reported within Other operating income 
The main types of assets leased by the Company are, in order of materiality, 
real estate, vehicles and IT-equipment  Vehicles are mainly used under service 
The Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities arising from 
all leases in the balance sheet, with some exceptions  In the assessment of a 
lease contract the lease components are separated from non-lease compo-
nents  The lease term is defined based on the contract lease term and when 
reasonably certain estimated extension or termination options are included  
The average remaining lease term for real estate contracts is around three 
years  For lease extensions not included in the lease liability there can be 
multiple options for different periods (overlapping) and they can have different 
stipulations for how the various options can be applied to be valid (limitations 
on size/scope) that must be maintained for extension  As a result, the future 
At commencement date the lease liabilities are measured at the present 
value of the lease payments not paid at the commencement date, discounted 
using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate  The Group estimates its 
incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities at the present value of 
lease payments as the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determi-
nable  The incremental borrowing rate is calculated considering interest swap 
rates, the creditworthiness of the entity that signs the lease and an adjustment 
for the asset being collateralized  Lease payments included in the liability are 
fixed payments, variable payments depending on an index or rate and penal-
The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line 
basis  Depreciation and any impairment charges are included in Cost of sales, 
Research and development expenses or Selling and administrative expenses  
The Company applies the recognition exemption for short-term leases and 
leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and recognizes the lease 
payments for those leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease 
When the Company acts as a lessor, it is mainly in relation to real estate 
sublease, financing and operating  For more information regarding leases, see 
For further disclosure, see the notes under section D 
Provisions are made when there are legal or constructive obligations as a result 
of past events and when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligations and the amounts can be reliably estimated  
When the effect of the time value of money is material, the estimated cash 
flows are discounted to present value  However, the actual outflows as a result 
of the obligations may differ from such estimates  Provisions mainly relate to 
restructuring, customer and supplier-related provisions, warranty commit-
ments, cash-settled share-based payments, claims or obligations as a result of 
A restructuring obligation is considered to have arisen when the Company 
has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring (approved by management), 
which has been communicated in such a way that a valid expectation has been 
raised among those affected  Curtailment gains and losses on defined benefit 
plans are reported as part of the net restructuring costs when the restructuring 
Customer-related provisions mainly consist of estimated losses on onerous 
contracts  For losses on customer contracts, a provision equal to the total 
estimated loss is recorded immediately when a loss from a contract is probable 
and can be estimated reliably  The loss is calculated based on the lower of the 
unavoidable costs to fulfill a contract and the exit penalty  The unavoidable 
cost includes both the incremental and allocated costs to fulfill the contract  
Supplier-related provisions relate to contractual commitments mostly 
relating to inventories  The provision is based on a risk assessment compar-
ing the forecasted sales volumes with the committed inventory levels  If the 
contractually committed inventory is assessed to be at risk of not being met, a 
provision is raised equal to the best estimate of the expected obsolescence or 
Product warranty commitments consider probabilities of all material quality 
issues based on historical performance for established products and expected 
performance for new products, estimates of repair cost per unit, and volumes 
sold still under warranty up to the reporting date 
Share-based payment provision relates to cash-settled share-based pro-
grams  Refer to the accounting policy under “Cash-settled plans ”
Other provisions relate mainly to patent infringements, litigations, and 
other provisions which do not fall within the defined categories  The Company 
provides for estimated future settlements related to patent infringements 
based on the probable outcome of each infringement  The actual outcome 
or actual cost of settling an individual infringement may vary from the 
Company’s estimate  The Company estimates the outcome of any potential 
patent infringement made known to the Company through assertion and the 
Company’s monitoring of patent-related cases in the relevant legal systems  
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, 
lawsuits, and other unresolved claims  These matters are often resolved over 
a long period of time  The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of any 
adverse judgments in or outcomes of these matters, as well as potential ranges 
Present or possible obligations that do not meet the provision recognition 
criteria are reported as contingent liabilities  For further detailed information, 
see note D2 “Contingent liabilities ” In note A2 “Critical accounting estimates 
and judgments,” further disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources 
of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting 
For further disclosure, see the notes under section E 
At the acquisition of a business, the cost of the acquisition, being the purchase 
price, is measured as the fair value of the assets acquired, and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, including any cost related to 
contingent consideration  Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition 
are expensed as incurred  The acquisition cost is allocated to acquired assets, 
liabilities, and contingent liabilities based upon appraisals made, including 
assets and liabilities that were not recognized on the acquired entity’s balance 
sheet, for example, intangible assets such as customer relationships, brands, 
patents, and financial liabilities  The Company, on an acquisition-by-acqui-
sition basis, chooses to measure any non-controlling interest in the acquiree 
either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of 
The acquired entity is consolidated into the Group results from the date of 
acquisition  Accordingly, the consolidated stockholders’ equity includes equity 
in subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associated companies earned only after 
Investments in associated companies is when the Company has significant 
influence and the ability to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the associated company but is not in control or joint control over 
those policies  Normally, this is the case in voting stock interest, including 
effective potential voting rights, which stand at least at 20% but not more than 
50%  Associated companies are accounted for in accordance with the equity 
method  Any change in other comprehensive income of the associated com-
panies is presented as part of other comprehensive income  If the Company’s 
interest in an associated company is nil, the Company does not recognize its 
part of any future losses  Provisions related to obligations for such an interest 
For further disclosure, see the notes under section F  Plan assets under IAS 19 
are excluded from the financial risk management policy and financial instru-
Financial assets are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument  Regular purchases and sales of 
financial securities are recognized on the settlement date  Financial assets 
are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have 
expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substan-
tially all risks and rewards of ownership  The Company sells its receivables 
with the expectation that all derecognition criteria are fully satisfied thereby 
no material asset or liability is retained  The Company classifies its financial 
assets in the following categories: at amortized cost, at fair value through 
other comprehensive income (FVOCI), and at fair value through profit or loss 
(FVTPL)  The classification depends on the cash flow characteristics of the 
The fair values of quoted financial investments and derivatives are based 
on quoted market prices or rates  If official rates or market prices are not avail-
able, fair values are calculated using observable inputs such as market prices 
for implied volatility, foreign exchange and interest rates  Where there are no 
observable market data, fair values are calculated using other inputs such 
as data from transactions, external evidence on exit price or other analytical 
Interest bearing assets, including cash equivalents, held with the objective to 
collect contractual cash flows, are classified as amortized cost assets  These 
include securities and deposits not managed on a fair value basis and loans 
Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income 
Trade receivables are classified as FVOCI because the business model is 
primarily to collect, with occasional sales  Sale of trade receivables are made 
when the liquidity need arises and competitive prices are available for such 
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss (FVTPL)
All financial assets that are not classified as either amortized cost or FVOCI are 
classified as FVTPL  Derivatives are classified as FVTPL, unless they are desig-
nated as hedging instruments for the purpose of hedge accounting  Derivatives 
assets and liabilities are offset where there is legally enforceable right to offset, 
and the Company settles on a net basis with the counterparties  Derivatives 
assets and liabilities (after offset) are classified as current and non-current 
based on the maturity of the contract, unless they are intended and expected 
Interest-bearing assets including investment in securities and money 
market funds are classified as FVTPL where they are either held in a portfolio 
managed on a fair value basis or held for short-term liquidity purposes 
Customer finance receivables are classified as FVTPL because they are 
primarily held for sale  These assets are presented on the balance sheet based 
on their maturity date (i e , those with a maturity longer than one year are 
presented as non-current)  Investments in shares and participations are classi-
fied as FVTPL and presented as non-current financial assets 
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of investment in 
shares and participations are presented in the income statement within other 
Gains and losses on derivatives are presented in the income statement as 
follows: Gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge foreign exchange risks 
are presented within net foreign exchange gains and losses  Gains and losses 
on interest rate derivatives used to hedge financial assets and liabilities are 
presented in financial income and financial expense, respectively  
Gains and losses on revaluation of customer financing receivables are 
presented in the income statement as selling expenses  Gains and losses 
arising from changes in the fair values of all other assets in the FVTPL category 
are presented in the income statement within financial income 
Dividends on equity instruments are recognized in the income statement 
as part of financial income when the Company’s right to receive payments is 
At each balance sheet date, financial assets classified as either amortized 
cost or FVOCI and contract assets are assessed for impairment based on 
Expected Credit Losses (ECL)  The Company adopts a simplified approach for 
trade receivables and contract assets whereby allowances are always equal 
to lifetime ECL  The Company has established a provision matrix based on 
historical credit loss experience, which has been adjusted for current conditions 
and expectations of future economic conditions  The losses are recognized on 
a separate line in the income statement  When there is no reasonable expecta-
Other amortized costs assets are mainly investment grade assets deemed 
to be low risk hence credit risk is assumed not to have increased significantly 
since initial recognition  If the Company identifies evidence of significant 
change in credit risk on the assets, lifetime ECL is used to calculate allowance 
on the asset  Default is deemed if the asset is more than 90 days past due, after 
which lifetime ECL is also used to calculate allowance on the asset 
Financial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes bound to the 
Financial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i e , when 
the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired 
Trade payables are recognized as amortized cost liabilities  Some suppliers 
sell their Ericsson receivables to banks and the Company can if requested 
introduce a bank interested in purchasing such receivables  The Company does 
not pay or receive a fee, nor provide additional security under the program  This 
arrangement does not lead to any significant change in the nature or function 
of the Company’s liabilities because the supplier invoices are considered part of 
working capital used in the Company’s normal operating cycle  The maximum 
credit period agreed with any supplier does not exceed six months  Therefore, 
these liabilities remain classified as trade payables with separate disclosure in 
Borrowings issued by the Parent Company are designated FVTPL where they 
are managed on a fair value basis  These are long term borrowings held in an 
Asset and liability management portfolio where the interest rate risk is man-
aged by matching fixed and floating interest rates of interest-bearing balance 
sheet items  Changes in fair value of this portfolio are recognized in financial 
expense, except for changes in fair value due to changes in credit risk which are 
Borrowings not managed on a fair value basis are classified as amortized 
cost liabilities  These include revolving credit facilities and commercial papers 
program which are used for short term liquidity purposes and cash collaterals 
Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Company has an 
unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months 
The Company has the following recurring hedge programs: 
a) Certain customer contracts where a fluctuation in the USD/SEK foreign 
exchange (FX) rate would significantly impact net sales  These contracts are 
multi-year contracts denominated in USD with highly probable payments at 
b) Highly probable forecasted sales denominated in USD in Ericsson AB (EAB) 
for the next 7 to 18 months are hedged on a monthly rolling basis 
For both programs, the Company enters into FX forward contracts that match 
the terms of the foreign exchange exposure as closely as possible and desig-
At inception, the Company documents the economic relationship between 
the hedged item and hedging instrument  For FX hedges, the hedge ratio is 
usually 1:1  The Company designates changes in forward rates as the hedged 
risk  When applying hedge accounting, the effective portion of changes in the 
fair value of derivatives that is designated and qualifies as cash flow hedges is 
recognized in OCI  The gain or loss relating to an ineffective portion is recog-
nized immediately in Financial income and expenses, net  Upon recognition 
of the hedged net sales, the cumulative amount in cash flow hedge reserve is 
released in the OCI as a reclassification adjustment and recognized in net sales 
In addition to the recurring hedge programs, cash flow hedge is also des-
ignated for certain highly probable acquisition expected to be transacted in 
foreign currencies  FX derivatives are used as hedging instruments, at a hedge 
ratio of 1:1  The Company designates changes in forward rates as the hedged 
risks  The accounting is similar to that described for the cash flow hedge 
above, except that upon recognition of the hedged acquisition, the cumulative 
amount in the cash flow hedge reserve is released and recognized as a basis 
For further disclosure, see the notes under section G 
Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as either defined 
contribution plans or defined benefit plans  These include gratuity plans, 
medical plans and leave encashment plans which are expected to be provided 
The present value of the defined benefit obligations for current and former 
employees is calculated using the Projected Unit Credit Method  The discount 
rate for each country is determined by reference to market yields on high-
quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms 
of the Company’s obligations  In countries where there is no deep market for 
such bonds such as Sweden the market yields on government bonds are used  
The calculations are based upon actuarial assumptions that are updated 
annually  The Company’s net liability for each defined benefit plan consists of 
the present value of pension commitments less the fair value of plan assets 
and is recognized net on the balance sheet  When the result is a net benefit to 
the Company, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of any future 
refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan, referred 
to as ‘asset ceiling’  The pension asset is presented as Other Financial assets, 
Interest cost on the defined benefit obligation and interest income on plan 
assets is calculated as a net interest amount and presented within Financial 
expenses  Curtailment gains and losses due to restructuring programs are 
recognized as part of the restructuring costs  Settlement events are considered 
as risk management activities driven by Group Treasury functions, therefore 
any gains and losses are presented within Financial expenses  Swedish special 
payroll tax is accounted for as a part of the pension cost, and the pension 
Payroll taxes related to actuarial gains and losses are included in determin-
ing actuarial gains and losses, reported under OCI

is presented in relation to key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Share-based compensation to employees and the Board of Directors
Share-based compensation relates to remuneration to employees, including 
key management personnel and the Board of Directors, and could be settled in 
The majority of the granted share-based programs are cash-settled, except 
for programs for the Executive Team and the long-term variable compensation 
(LTV) 2023 program  These programs are share-settled  Share-settled plans 
will be settled in the Parent Company Class B shares provided the market-
related and non-market-related vesting conditions are met 
Compensation costs are recognized during the vesting period, based on the 
fair value of the Ericsson share at the grant date, and considers performance 
and market-related vesting conditions  All plans have service conditions, while 
some have performance and market-related vesting conditions  Examples of 
performance conditions could be revenue and profit targets and market condi-
tions relate to the development of the Parent Company’s share price in relation 
For further detailed information, see note G3 “Share-based compensation ” 
The total compensation expense for a cash-settled plan is equal to the pay-
ments made to the employees at the date of the end of the service period  
The fair value of the synthetic shares, being the cash equivalents of shares, is 
therefore reassessed and amended during the service period, and accounted 
for as a provision  Otherwise the accounting is similar to a share-settled plan  
Cash-settled plans relating to employees’ share-based payment programs 
have similar vesting criteria to share-settled plans  All plans have service condi-
tions, while some have performance and market-related vesting conditions  
Up to and including 2022, non-executive directors could elect to receive part 
of their remuneration as synthetic shares, which will be converted to cash at 
the end of a specified vesting period based upon the market value of the class 
B shares in the Parent company at the time of payment

Income taxes in the consolidated financial statements include both current 
and deferred taxes  Income taxes do not include VAT, sales/use taxes, or other 
taxes not based on taxable profits  Income taxes are reported in the income 
statement unless the underlying item is reported directly in equity or OCI  For 
those items, the related income tax is also reported directly in equity or OCI  A 
current tax liability or asset is recognized for the estimated taxes payable or 
Current income tax and deferred taxes are measured at the tax rate that is 
expected to be applied based on the tax laws that have been enacted or sub-
stantially enacted for the reporting period in the corresponding jurisdiction 
Deferred tax is recognized for temporary differences between the book 
values of assets and liabilities and their tax values for unused tax loss carry-
forwards and for unused tax credits  A deferred tax asset is recognized only to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the deductible temporary differences, tax loss carry-forwards and tax 
credits can be utilized  In the recognition of income taxes, the Company offsets 
current tax receivables against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets 
against deferred tax liabilities in the balance sheet, when the Company has a 
legal right to offset these items and the intention to do so  Deferred tax is not 
recognized for temporary differences when it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future  
In note A2 “Critical accounting estimates and judgments,” further disclosure 
is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the 
decision made in relation to accounting policies applied 
The statement of cash flows is prepared using the indirect method  Cash flows 
from foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rate during 
the period  For practical reasons, the Company uses the closing rate of the 
previous month end as approximation of the period average exchange rate  
Payments for subsidiaries acquired or divested are reported as cash flow from 
investing activities, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired or disposed of 
respectively  Movements in cash collaterals received and bank borrowings 
less than 3 months (used for short-term liquidity purposes) are presented net 
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash, bank, and interest-bearing 
securities that are highly liquid monetary financial instruments with a remain-
ing maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition 
Government grants are recognized when there is reasonable assurance that 
the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and the grants 
will be received  Government grants received are mainly recognized in the 
consolidated income statement as a deduction against the related expense 
The Company has performed an analysis of how different climate scenarios 
could affect the Company and its value chain  The analysis did not identify any 
short-term material financial risks or changes to significant accounting policies 
and accounting estimates  In the middle to long-term horizon, carbon pricing 
and potential scarcity in raw materials used in products and equipment affect-
ing actors in the upstream value chain, as well as disruptions in supply due to 
severe weather events have been identified as emerging risks  The Company 
intends to refine the analysis and assess climate-related financial implications 
On January 1, 2023, the following amendments issued by the IASB were 
adopted with no material impact on the results and financial position of the 
Company  – IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (including the June 2020 and December 2021 
amendments to IFRS 17, which establishes principles for the recognition, 
measurements, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts) – Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS 
Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting policies – Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors – Definition of Accounting Estimates – Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes – Deferred Tax related to Assets and 
Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction  – Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes: International Tax Reform – Pillar 
The application of the amendment to IAS 1 above resulted in a reassessment 
and revision to the of the Company’s existing accounting policies disclosure 
compared to what was previously disclosed in the 2022 financial statements, 
taking into consideration the materiality of the related accounting items  On 13 December 2023, the government of Sweden, where the parent company 
is incorporated, enacted the Pillar Two income taxes legislation effective from 
1 January 2024  Under the legislation, the parent company will be required 
to pay, in Sweden, top-up tax on profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed at an 
effective tax rate of less than 15 per cent unless this is due and payable locally  
Management does not believe that there will be any material impact on the 
results of the Group’s operations for the year ending 31 December 2024 in any 
of the main jurisdictions in which Ericsson currently operates  The Group is continuing to assess the impact of Pillar Two income taxes 
legislation on its future financial performance, however, based on the analysis 
performed management does not expect the legislation effective in 2024 will 
have a material impact on the results of operations or cash flows for the year 
ending 31 December 2024 or the financial position as at that date 
A number of new amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet 
effective for the year ended December 31, 2023, and have not been applied in 
The IASB has issued the following new amendments with effective date 
January 1, 2024: – Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – Classification 
of liabilities as current or non-current – Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements – Non-current 
liabilities with covenants – Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases – Lease liability in a sale and leaseback – Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial 
Instruments – Disclosures: Supplier Finance Arrangements
– These amendments will increase the disclosures for Supplier Finance 
The Company has finalized the evaluation of any impact on financial results 
or position from these amendments and concluded that they will not have a 
material impact on the results and financial position of the Company 
The IASB has issued the following new amendment with effective date 
January 1, 2025: – Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates: 
The Company has not finalized the evaluation of any impact on financial 
results or position from this amendment and its effect on the results and finan-
The preparation of financial statements and application of accounting 
standards often involve management’s judgment and the use of estimates and 
assumptions deemed to be reasonable at the time they are made  However, 
other results may be derived with different judgments or using different 
assumptions or estimates, and events may occur that could require a material 
adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected  Examples 
of this could occur with a change in strategy or restructuring  Judgments for 
accounting policies to be applied as well as estimates may also be impacted 
due to this  The following are the most important accounting policies subject 
to such judgments and the key sources of estimation uncertainty that the 
Company believes could have the most material impact on the reported results 
The information in this note is grouped as per: – Key sources of estimation uncertainty – Judgments management has made in the process of applying the 
The Company uses estimates and judgments in determining the amount and 
timing of revenue particularly when determining the transaction price and its 
allocation to performance obligations identified under the contract 
Transaction price, including variable considerations, for example volume 
rebate earnings, is estimated at the commencement of the contract (and 
periodically thereafter)  Judgment is used in the estimation process based on 
historical experience with the type of business and customer  This includes 
assessment of price concession based on latest available information on 
contract negotiations that could have retrospective impact on prices for prod-
The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach to estimate 
stand-alone selling prices for its products and services for the purposes of 
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied 
Management applies judgment when assessing the customer’s ability and 
intention to pay in a contract  The assessment is based on the latest customer 
credit standing and the customer’s past payment history  This assessment may 
change during the contract execution, and if there is evidence of deterioration 
in the customer’s ability or intention to pay, then no further revenue shall be 
recognized until the collectability criteria is met  Conversely, this assessment 
may also change favorably over time, upon which revenue shall now be recog-
nized on a contract that did not initially meet the collectability criteria 
Revenue for standard products is recognized when control over the equip-
ment is transferred to the customer at a point in time  This assessment shall be 
viewed from a customer’s perspective considering indicators such as transfer 
of titles and risks, customer acceptance, physical possession, and billing rights  
Judgment may be applied in determining whether risk and rewards have 
been transferred to the customer and whether the customer has accepted the 
products  Often all indicators of transfer of control are assessed together and 
an overall judgment formed as to when transfer of control has occurred in a 
Impairment allowance on receivables and contract assets
The Company monitors the financial stability of its customers, the environ-
ments in which they operate and historical credit losses  This is combined 
with expectations of future economic conditions to calculate expected credit 
losses (ECLs)  ECLs on trade receivables and contract assets are assessed 
using a provision matrix based on days past due for groupings of customers 
that are classified as low, medium and high  The amount of ECLs is sensitive 
to changes in the payment patterns, circumstances of our customers and the 
environments in which they operate as well as management’s expectations 
of future economic conditions  Actual credit losses may be higher or lower 
than expected, therefore are regularly monitored to ensure the provision 
matrix is updated if required  Total allowances for expected credit losses as 
of December 31, 2023 were SEK 2 6 (2 5) billion or 5% (4%) of gross trade 
receivables and contract assets  For further detailed information see note F1 
Customer financing receivables are valued at fair value on an individual 
basis  When market pricing is not available, an internal valuation model is 
applied considering external credit rating, political and commercial risks and 
bank pricing  Regular monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the 
internal assessment  At December 31, 2023, the fair value of customer finance 
receivables amounted to SEK 6 9 (5 4) billion  For further detailed information 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value  Estimates 
are required in relation to forecasted sales volumes, prices and inventory 
balances  Inventory write-downs during the period, amounted to SEK 4 0 (3 9) 
billion or 10% (8%) of gross inventory at year end  For further detailed informa-
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied
In situations where excess inventory balances are identified, estimates of 
net realizable values for the excess volumes are made  
Allowances for obsolescence in inventory considers aging, historical 
consumption and judgments around market demands  There may also be 
judgments around internal and external circumstances, e g  withdrawal of 
a product or economic and political changes in the global market  
Acquired customer relationships, intellectual property rights and other 
At initial recognition, future cash flows are estimated, to ensure that the 
initial carrying values do not exceed the expected discounted cash flows for 
the items of this type of asset  After initial recognition, impairment testing is 
performed when there is an indication of impairment  Additionally, goodwill 
impairment testing is performed once per year aligned with updated business 
plans  An indication of impairment may be a material deviation in actual cash 
flows compared to the business plan as well as new estimates that indicate 
lower future cash flows  The estimation uncertainty is considered higher for 
the Enterprise segment than the other segments in the next twelve months  
Impairment losses for intangible assets and goodwill amounted to SEK –31 9 
At December 31, 2023, the carrying amount of acquired intangible assets 
amounted to SEK 75 6 (110 9) billion, including goodwill of SEK 52 9 (84 6) 
For further discussion on goodwill, see note A1 “Material accounting poli-
cies ” Estimates related to acquired intangible assets are based on similar 
assumptions and risks as goodwill  For more information, see note C1 
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied
At initial recognition and subsequent remeasurement, management judgments are made, both for key assumptions and impairment indicators  
Management judgment is required for the purchase price allocation, for 
example when determining the fair values of acquired intangible assets  
Judgment is also required in defining the cash-generating units for impairment 
Estimation uncertainty exists due to possible future changes in business 
operations, which may impact the actual lease term of a contract  For example, 
if a restructuring program is initiated which could mean termination of existing 
lease contracts  The determination of the rates at which the lease liabilities are 
discounted is another uncertainty and this affects the lease liability and inter-
est expense amounts  At December 31, 2023, lease liabilities amounted to SEK 
7 5 (9 3) billion  For more information, see note C3 “Leases ”
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied
At initial recognition and subsequent remeasurement, management judgment 
is used for the term applied in a lease contract  The outcome of these judg-
ments may turn out not to match the actual outcome of the lease and may 
have an adverse effect on the right-of-use assets  An incremental borrowing 
rate is used in discounting of the lease liabilities and requires judgment to 
reflect the rate of interest that would have to be paid to borrow over a similar 
term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a 
similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment  
The key sources of estimation uncertainty relating to provisions are the assess-
ment of the probability of outflow and whether a reliable estimate can be 
made  Supplier-related provisions require a reliable forecast of sales volumes 
to estimate the expected usage of the committed inventory purchases  
Therefore, estimation uncertainty exists regarding the forecast and expected 
usage to assess the risk and the provision amount  Estimation uncertainty 
exists regarding restructuring provisions as the eventual outcome of the 
program, in terms of costs and actual impacted employees, may differ from the 
estimates made in the management plan  Estimation uncertainty exists with 
respect to ongoing internal investigations, proceedings and other matters with 
government and regulatory authorities  The Company’s internal investigation 
and its cooperation with authorities in relation to the matters discussed in the 
2019 internal Iraq investigation report remain open and ongoing  Estimation 
uncertainty over the expected settlement relating to litigation and disputes 
including intellectual property related topics such as patents exists as they 
may continue over several years and the outcome is unknown  
The same estimation uncertainties described above for provisions exist for 
contingent liabilities  Contingent liabilities mainly relate to estimates for litiga-
tion including intellectual property related topics such as patents, tax litigation, 
losses on customer contracts, and pension guarantees  As the contingent 
liabilities will only be confirmed in the future based on the resolution of the 
litigation or dispute, management is required to estimate the possibility of an 
adverse outcome occurring and the potential settlement value  A contingent 
liability may exist at year end, and or expense (provision) may have to be 
recognized at a later stage based on the latest conditions and progress of the 
Provisions and contingent liabilities are regularly reassessed based on the 
latest information available and are adjusted to reflect the Company’s best 
At December 31, 2023, provisions amounted to SEK 11 7 (11 6) billion  For further detailed information, see note D1 “Provisions ”
At December 31, 2023, contingent liabilities disclosed amounted to 
SEK 3 0 (3 3) billion  For further detailed information, see note D2 “Contingent 
liabilities” including a description of contingent liabilities which cannot be 
Judgments made in relation to accounting policies applied
The nature and type of risks for these provisions and contingencies differ and 
management applies judgment regarding the nature and extent of the obliga-
tions in deciding the probability of the outcome  Further judgment is required 
in determining the value of the present or possible obligation as this is based 
on the Company’s best estimate as to the expected future expenditure required 
Accounting for the costs of defined benefit pension plans and other applicable 
post-employment benefits is based on actuarial valuations, relying on key 
estimates for discount rates, future salary increases, employee turnover rates 
and mortality tables  The discount rate assumptions are based on rates for 
high-quality fixed-income investments with durations as close as possible to 
the Company’s pension plans  In countries where there is not a deep market 
in high-quality corporate bonds, the market yields on government bonds shall 
be applied  Judgment is applied in determining the depth of the high-quality 
corporate bond market in each country  The impact of applying an alternative 
discount rate based on Swedish covered bonds is disclosed in note G1, “Post-
employment benefits ” At December 31, 2023, defined benefit obligations 
for pensions and other post-employment benefits amounted to SEK 85 5 
(83 7) billion and fair value of plan assets amounted to SEK 62 6 (60 5) billion

jurisdictions where the profits arise  As prescribed in IFRIC 23, only uncertainty 
over income tax treatment is considered if and when recognizing and measur-
Assets relating to value added tax, and other taxes are separately assessed 
for recoverability in each jurisdiction according to the local regulations 
The total complexity of rules related to taxes and the accounting for these 
require management’s involvement in judgments regarding classification of

Judgments made and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The Company has considered the effect of climate-related factors on the 
financial statements, see references in the notes B5 “Inventories“ and C1 
“Intangible Assets“ on measurements of non-financial assets  There are also 
long-term incentive plans with specific climate-related targets as described in

When determining Ericsson’s operating segments, consideration has been 
given to the financial reporting reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (CODM)  Markets and what type of customers the products and services 
aim to attract has been considered, as well as the distribution channels they 
are sold through  Commonality regarding technology, research and develop-
ment has also been taken into account  To best reflect the business focus, three 
operating segments are presented: – Networks – Cloud Software and Services – Enterprise
Segment Networks offers multi-technology-capable Radio Access Network

cient products  The current radio product offering largely reflects the latest and 
most energy efficient technologies and ongoing improvements are expected 
in future  These factors have been included in the inventory obsolescence risk 
Physical risks of climate changes on manufacturing facilities have also been 
identified as a potential climate-related risk to the Company’s operations, 
although these risks are mostly mitigated through having appropriate insur-
ance policies for damage to inventories and fixed assets, as well as potential 
business interruptions  The Company also has a globally spread production 
capability as well as geographically diverse sourcing channels to mitigate 
risks of supply interruptions due to natural disasters, including severe weather

The total goodwill for the Company is SEK 52 9 (84 6) billion and is allocated to 
the operating segments Networks, with SEK 27 8 (28 5) billion, Cloud Software 
and Services, with SEK 3 5 (3 6) billion and Enterprise, with SEK 21 6 (52 5) bil-

SEK 9 0 (9 0)  billion  Segment Other does not carry goodwill  More information 
In 2023 an impairment charge of goodwill attributed to the acquisition of 
Vonage by SEK -31 9 billion was made in the cash generating unit, CGU, 
Vonage and reported on the line item Other operating expenses in the income 
statement for segment Enterprise  The reason for the impairment was mainly 
due to macroeconomic headwinds, including rising interest rates and changing 
demand trends  The impairment charge represented 50% of the total amount 
of goodwill and other intangible assets attributed to the Vonage acquisition  
For more information, see note E2 “Business combinations ” The recoverable 
amount for the CGU was SEK 29 5 billion  this amount was determined by 
value in use and was higher than the value determined by Fair value less costs 
In 2022 there was an impairment loss of intangibles of SEK 61 million in a 
business related to the Internet of Things in segment Enterprise due to a strate-
gic decision to discontinue the business operation, which is reported on the line 
item Research and development expenses in the income statement 
In 2021 there was an impairment loss of SEK 176 million in the restated 
segment Enterprise and an impairment loss of SEK 137 million in the restated 
The carrying value of customer relationships, IPR, and other intangible assets 
is SEK 22 7 (26 3) billion, of which customer relationships, acquired through

The Company capitalizes 5G radio product development costs and Enterprise 
platform costs which are amortized over a period of 3 years  In considering the 
Company’s climate-related aim to have more energy efficient products, the 
Company continually assesses the impact of future radio product improve-
ments on the recoverability of such development costs  The conclusion is that 
the carrying value at year-end is appropriate as the amortization period and 
product development lifecycle are relatively short 
Goodwill allocation has not changed during 2023 but goodwill of SEK 0 3 
billion has been added to the CGU Cradlepoint within segment Enterprise from 
the acquisition of Ericom of SEK 0 3 billion  Goodwill from the Vonage acquisi-
tion made in 2022 has been allocated to the Vonage CGU within segment 
Each of segment Networks and segment Cloud Software and Services is a CGU  
There are several CGUs within segment Enterprise  The value in use method 
has been applied for goodwill impairment testing, which means that the 
recoverable amounts for CGUs are established as the present value of expected 
future cash flows based on business plans approved by management  The 
assumptions are also based on the Company’s market share ambition and 
upon information gathered in the Company’s long-term strategy process, 
including assessments of new technology, the Company’s competitive position 
Estimation of future cash flows includes assumptions mainly for the follow-
ing key financial parameters: – Sales growth – Development of EBIT (based on EBIT margin or cost of goods sold and 
operating expenses relative to sales) – Related development of working capital and capital expenditure 
The assumptions regarding industry-specific market drivers and market 
growth are based on industry sources as input to the projections made within 
the Company for the development 2024–2028 for key telecom industry 
parameters: – By 2028, about 37 years after the introduction of digital mobile technology, 
it is predicted that there will be 9 1 billion mobile subscriptions (excl  Cellular 
IoT) compared to 8 5 billion in 2023  Out of all mobile subscriptions, 8 2 
billion will be associated with a smartphone  – The number of 5G subscriptions is forecasted to reach 4 7 billion (excluding 
Cellular IoT) by the end of 2028 compared to 1 6 billion in 2023  – By 2028, about 46 billion connected devices are forecasted compared 
to 26 billion in 2023, of the 46 billion around 30 billion will be related to 
Internet of Things, IoT  Connected IoT devices includes connected cars, 
machines, meters, sensors, point-of-sale terminals, consumer electronics 
and wearables  – Cellular IoT is predicted to grow from 3 5 billion devices in end of 2024 to 
5 5 billion devices in end of 2028  – Mobile data traffic volume is estimated to increase by more than two times 
in the period 2024–2028  The mobile traffic is driven by smartphone users 
and video traffic, with mobile video traffic forecasted to grow by almost 25% 
annually through 2028 to account for more than 70% of all mobile data traf-
fic  Fixed Wireless Access is another contributor to mobile traffic, growing 
with more than 30% annually in the period to account for more than 25% of 
Sales growth in the Enterprise segment is driven by the adoption of 5G and 
the convergence of 5G and Cloud communications in the enterprise market  
The Enterprise Wireless WAN addressable market is expected to grow with a 
CAGR of 24% 2022–2027  The global CPaaS market is expected to grow with 
a CAGR of approximately 24% 2023–2026, with the growth mainly driven by 
The CGUs Vonage and Cradlepoint have assumed a forecasted com-
pounded annual growth rate above 15% (20%) over the next five years 
followed by a gradual decline in growth rates  The assumptions reflect the 
expected high growth market conditions in which both CGUs are present  
Market maturity and market growth at long term sustainable levels (nominal 
rates described above) are not expected to be reached until after the 5-year 
forecast period  It is noted that it is more difficult to estimate market conditions 
The forecasted cash flows to calculate recoverable amounts are based on 
five-year explicit business plans  For the CGUs Vonage and Cradlepoint an 
additional two years have been added to reflect the progression towards the 
There are no reasonably possible changes that would lead to the carrying 
value not being recoverable for any CGU, except for Vonage  The recoverable 
amount of CGU Vonage exceeds the carrying amount by SEK 1 1 billion  This 
CGU was written down to its recoverable amount in Q3 2023  The current 
head room comes mainly from the amortization of intangible assets since the 
write-down  The recoverable amount for CGU Vonage would equal the carry-
ing value, if the long-term EBIT margin would be decreased by 1%, or if sales 
CAGR during the forecast period or terminal growth rate decreased by 1%  
Likewise, an increase in the applied WACC would give the same outcome  
An after-tax discount rate has been applied for the discounting of projected 
after-tax cash flows  This discounting is not materially different from a dis-
counting based on before-tax future cash flows and before-tax discount rates, 
as required by IFRS  The higher rates for Vonage and Cradlepoint are partly 
driven by increased uncertainty and partly by the higher risk-free rate implied 
by USD treasury bonds, which are used for these CGUs as the cash flows are

Provisions will fluctuate over time depending on the business mix, market mix 
and technology shifts  Risk assessment in the ongoing business is performed 
monthly to identify the need for new additions and reversals  Management 
uses its best judgment to estimate provisions based on this assessment  Under 
certain circumstances, provisions are no longer required due to outcomes 
being more favorable than anticipated, which affect the provision balance as 
a reversal  In other cases, the outcome can be negative, and if so, a charge is 
For 2023, the total provision value is SEK 11 7 (11 6) billion, of which 
SEK 4 9 (4 0) billion is classified as non-current  The significant restructuring 
provision additions of SEK 6 1 billion and utilization of SEK 2 9 billion is due 
to the cost-reduction activities announced during the year  Other provisions 
utilization of SEK 3 8 billion includes the payment of USD 206 7 million 
(approximately SEK 2 2 billion) for the fine in relation to the resolution of previ-
ously announced, non-criminal, alleged breaches under the deferred prosecu-
tion agreement (DPA) with the United States Department of Justice (DoJ)

“Critical accounting estimates and judgments” for key estimation uncertainty 
Restructuring provisions relate to structural efficiency programs that are 
planned and controlled by management and have a material impact on either 
the scope of the business undertaken or the manner in which the business 
is conducted  Restructuring provisions in 2023 relate to the cost-reduction 
activities that have resulted in fundamental reorganizations of the impacted 
units  The scope of the structural efficiency measures involves service delivery, 
supply and manufacturing, R&D, and selling and administration expenses  
Restructuring provisions are recognized based on the expected costs of the 
respective restructuring programs and primarily consist of personnel costs  
Estimation uncertainty exists regarding the execution of the restructuring 
programs, which may impact the expected timing and realization of costs  
Restructuring provisions are reviewed and adjusted regularly based on man-
agement’s best estimate  The expected timing and amount of outflows are 
dependent on whether the plan execution is in line with management’s assess-
ment  The majority of the restructuring provision will be utilized within 1 year  
For more information about the restructuring charges booked in the income 
Customer-related provisions mainly consist of provisions for losses on cus-
tomer contracts  To measure the customer-related provisions, management 
estimates the unavoidable costs to fulfill the obligations under the customer 
contract  If the exit penalty is lower than the estimated costs to fulfill the 
contract, then the provision value is limited to the exit penalty value  The 
unavoidable costs to fulfill the contract sometimes differ from management’s 
estimates  Provisions raised for loss-making customer contracts are therefore 
regularly reviewed and adjusted based on the latest information available 
considering the realization of the costs estimated  The expected timing and 
amount of outflows are dependent on whether the customer contract execu-
tion is in line with management’s assessment  The majority of the customer-
Supplier-related provisions are for supplier claims/guarantees based on the 
contractual obligations mostly relating to inventory  The provision is calculated 
by comparing the committed inventory purchases with the expected usage 
based on a forecast of sales volumes, and any excess is provided for based 
on an assessment of the risk of obsolescence  If the committed inventory is 
not required to be purchased, but a fee is chargeable by the vendor due to 
the failure to meet the committed volumes, then the provision is based on 
the expected fee to be incurred  Estimation uncertainty exists regarding the 
expected usage and sales volumes forecast and, if applicable, the assessment 
of the risk of obsolescence, as these are based on management’s expectations  
When the committed inventory is purchased, the provision is reclassified 
from provisions to inventory allowances  The expected timing and amount 
of outflows are dependent on the actual outcome of the supplier claims and 
guarantees  The majority of the supplier-related provisions will be utilized over 
Warranty provisions are based on historic quality rates for established products 
as well as estimates regarding quality rates for new products and costs to 
remedy the various types of faults predicted  Uncertainty exists regarding the 
timing and amount as management utilizes the historical trends to estimate 
the warranty provisions as well as the cost to repair or replace, which may differ 
from the actual outcomes  New product warranty provisions require further 
estimation since historical information is not available  These provisions do 
not include costs for service in additions within customer contracts that are 
accounted for as separate performance obligations  The expected timing and 
amount of outflows are dependent on the actual product faults which may 
occur  The majority of the warranty provisions are expected to be utilized 
Share-based payments provisions relate to cash-settled share-based pro-
grams and are based on the present period’s best estimate of the eventual 
pay-outs, see note G3 “Share-based compensation” for more information  
The uncertainty regarding outflows is relating to the fair value of the under-
lying instrument during the service period and expected fulfilment of the 
service conditions  Share-based payment provisions will be utilized according 
to the awards’ vesting dates and will be utilized over a period of 3 years 
Other provisions mostly relate to litigation and patent infringement disputes  
Management regularly assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes relat-
ing to ongoing litigations and disputes, and if deemed probable then a provi-
sion is raised based on the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
with the counterpart  There is uncertainty in the final outcome and settlement, 
therefore management reviews the estimation regularly  Outflows relating to 
litigations are inherently uncertain regarding timing and amount, and there-
fore the majority of the provisions are classified as current, but outflows may 
happen over a number of years depending on when settlement is reached 
Contingent liabilities mainly relate to, in order of materiality, tax litigations in 
subsidiaries, other litigations and disputes, including related to intellectual 
property matters, pension guarantees and losses on customer contracts, 
which are assessed to be possible obligations for the Company  The Company 
actively manages its IPR portfolio and its need for third party licenses and 
is involved from time to time, in the ordinary course of business, in litigation 
related thereto, as plaintiff, defendant and other capacities  The Company also 
monitors the performance of obligations due to it by third party vendors and 
other suppliers and takes appropriate action where necessary to secure such 
performance  The single largest contingent liability relates to the pension com-
mitments in Sweden of SEK 0 6 (0 5) billion  See note G1 “Post-employment 
benefits” for more information on the pension contingent liability in Sweden 
Outflows relating to litigation, both tax and legal, due to their nature are 
inherently uncertain regarding timing and amount  All ongoing litigations 
are, therefore, regularly evaluated, their potential economic outflows and 
probability estimated, and necessary provisions made, or contingent liabilities 
disclosed  In note A2 “Critical accounting estimates and judgments,” further 
disclosure is presented in relation to (i) key sources of estimation uncertainty 
and (ii) the decision made in relation to accounting policies applied 
As part of its defense to a now settled patent infringement lawsuit filed by 
Ericsson in 2013 in the Delhi High Court against Indian handset company 
Micromax, Micromax filed a complaint against Ericsson with the Competition 
Commission of India (CCI)  The CCI decided to refer the case to the Director 
General’s Office for an in-depth investigation  The CCI opened similar inves-
tigations against Ericsson in January 2014 based on claims made by Intex 
Technologies (India) Limited and, in 2015, based on a now settled claim from 
iBall  Ericsson has challenged CCI’s jurisdiction in these cases before the Delhi 
On July 13, 2023, the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court found that 
in this instance the CCI has no power to conduct the pending investigations 
against Ericsson  The CCI has appealed this order to the Supreme Court of 
In April 2019, Ericsson was informed by China’s State Administration for 
Market Regulation (SAMR) Anti-monopoly bureau that SAMR has initiated 
an investigation into Ericsson’s patent licensing practices in China  Ericsson is 
cooperating with the investigation, which is still in a fact-finding phase  The 
next steps include continued fact finding and meetings with SAMR in order 
to facilitate the authority’s assessments and conclusions  In case of adverse 
findings, SAMR has the power to impose behavioral and financial remedies 
The above matters relating to Micromax and SAMR are possible obligations 
which cannot be quantified and are, therefore, not included in the contingent

The Company’s financial risk management is governed by a policy approved 
by the Board of Directors  The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing 
the capital structure and financial management of the Company, approving 
certain matters (such as investments, customer finance commitments and 
borrowing) and setting limits on the exposure to financial risks 
For the Company, a robust financial position with an investment grade 
rating, low leverage and ample liquidity is deemed important  This provides 
financial flexibility and independence to operate and manage variations in 
working capital needs as well as to invest in business opportunities 
The Company’s overall capital structure should support the financial targets  
The capital structure is managed by balancing equity, debt financing and 
liquidity in such a way that the Company can secure funding of operations 
at a reasonable cost of capital  Regular borrowings are complemented with 
committed credit facilities to give additional flexibility to manage unforeseen 
funding needs  The Company strives to deliver strong free cash flow 
The Company’s capital objectives are: – Free cash flow before M&A of 9–12% of net sales – Positive net cash position – Investment grade rating by Moody’s (Baa3), S&P Global (BBB–) and Fitch

The Company is a global company with sales mainly outside Sweden  Sales 
and costs incurred are to a large extent denominated in currencies other 
than SEK and therefore the financial results of the Company are impacted by 
currency fluctuations  The Company reports the financial statements in SEK  
Movements in exchange rates between currencies that affect these statements 
Line items, primarily sales, are impacted by translation exposure incurred 
when converting foreign entities’ financial statements into SEK  Line items and 
profitability, such as EBIT are impacted by transaction exposure incurred when 
financial assets and liabilities, primarily trade receivables and trade payables, 
are initially recognized and subsequently remeasured due to changes in 
The table below presents the external net sales and cost exposures for the 
largest currencies which impact profitability  The internal exposures will not 
impact group profitability if all related transactions occur and are recognized in 
the profit and loss in the same month  Any effect on profit and loss from inter-
nal transactions is a function of timing and FX volatility, therefore impossible

Translation exposure relates to sales and cost incurred in foreign entities when 
converted into SEK upon consolidation  These exposures cannot be addressed 
The Company considers the following transaction exposures 
a) Transaction risk impacting net sales and net income
Transaction exposure relates to sales and cost incurred in non-reporting 
currencies in individual group companies  Foreign exchange risk is as far as 
possible concentrated in Swedish group companies, primarily Ericsson AB, by 
selling to foreign subsidiaries in either the functional currency of the customers, 
EUR or USD  This transaction risk can be hedged, although it is only done for 
material cash inflows or outflows that are highly certain  The Company has the 
i) The Company has identified certain customer contracts where a fluctuation 
in the USD/SEK foreign exchange rate would significantly impact net sales  
These contracts are multi-year contracts with highly probable payments at 
The Board of Directors has provided a mandate to the Company to hedge 
between 0%–100% of the next three years receipts on a rolling basis, up to the 
end of the contract period  This mandate instructs the treasury function to hedge 
a percentage of this exposure according to a defined scale, locking in a higher 
percentage of exposure as the USD strengthens against SEK, up to 100% 
ii) The Board of Directors has provided a mandate to the Company to hedge 
highly probable forecasted sales and purchases denominated in USD in EAB 
for the next 7 to 18 months, on a monthly rolling basis  This mandate instructs 
the treasury function to hedge a percentage of this exposure according to a 
defined scale, locking in a higher percentage of exposure as the USD strength-
For both programs, hedge accounting is applied, whereby the Company 
enters into foreign exchange forward contracts that match the terms of the 
foreign exchange exposure as closely as possible and designates them as 
hedging instruments  Hedge ineffectiveness is expected to be minimal but may 
arise due to differences in timing of the cash flows between the hedged items 
b) Transaction exposure in individual balance sheet
According to Company policy, transaction exposure in subsidiaries’ balance 
sheets (e g , trade receivables and trade payables that are remeasured due to 
change in foreign exchange rates) should be fully hedged  Foreign exchange 
exposures in balance sheet items are hedged through offsetting balances or 
derivatives  Foreign exchange exposures are managed net, and its effects are 
presented net within Financial income and expenses  This is not designated as 
As balance sheet hedging is done net on a monthly basis, significant volatility 
in USD hedge volumes exposes EAB to FX execution risk  In order to spread 
the FX execution risk over the year, 14% of each of the next six months fore-
casted sales and purchases in EAB are hedged monthly, whereby forecasted 
sales (excluding volume in the 7 to 18 month cash flow hedge program) are 
funded by internal loans and forecasted purchases funded by deposits with its parent company  Cash flow hedge accounting is not designated, therefore the 
FX impact on revaluation of the internal loan and deposit is recognized in net 
The sensitivity of the FX impact is dependent on changes in foreign 
exchange rates, forecasts and seasonality  USD is the only currency being 
hedged  Since the start of the 7 to 18 month cash flow hedge program in March 
2022, the USD sales volume funded by internal loan has steadily reduced, 
whereas the USD purchases volume reduced to a lesser extent  This resulted 
in a net deposit balance with its parent company throughout the second half 
of 2023  The outstanding net deposit at year-end is USD 199 million (loan 
of USD 149 million), with an average net loan balance of USD 52 million 
(USD 529 million) over the year  Net realized FX gain recognized is SEK 4 mil-
lion and unrealized loss is SEK 211 million, giving a total net loss of SEK 207 
The Company is exposed to FX execution risk on consideration payable 
for acquisition in foreign currency from the period of communication of the 
proposed transaction to final completion date  Such transaction, if deemed 
material and highly probable, will be hedged to protect the cash consideration 
Cash flow hedge accounting is applied, whereby the Company enters 
into foreign exchange forward contracts that match the terms of the foreign 
exchange exposure as closely as possible and designates them as hedging 
instruments  Hedge ineffectiveness is expected to be minimal but may arise

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk through market value fluctuations 
in certain balance sheet items and through changes in interest income and 
The Company uses the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology to measure foreign 
exchange and interest rate risks managed by the treasury function  This 
statistical method expresses the maximum potential loss that can arise with 
a certain degree of probability during a certain period of time  For the VaR 
measurement, the Company has chosen a probability level of 99% and a 
one-day time horizon  The daily VaR measurement uses market volatilities and 
correlations based on historical daily data (one year), with the limitation that 
historical data does not necessarily reflect future events 
The treasury function operates under two mandates  In the liquidity 
management activity, it has a mandate to deviate from floating interest on net 
liquidity and take foreign exchange positions up to an aggregated risk of VaR 
SEK 45 million given a confidence level of 99% and a one-day horizon  The 
average VaR calculated for 2023 was SEK 15 9 (21 0) million  No VaR limits 
In the asset-liability management activity, the interest rate risk is managed 
by matching fixed and floating interest rates in interest-bearing balance 
sheet items  The policy is that the net sensitivity on a one basis point move on 
interest-bearing assets matching interest-bearing liabilities, taking derivatives 
into consideration, is less than SEK 10 million  The average exposure during 
2023 was SEK 1 5 (1 5) million per basis point shift 
Sensitivity to interest rate increase of 1 basis point, SEK million

current receivables and SEK 679 (1,472) million in Other current liabilities

Hedge ratio is 1:1 and changes in forward rate have been designated as 
the hedged risk  The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is 
compared with the change in fair value of the hedged item, and the lower 
amount is taken to OCI  If the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is 
higher, then the excess change in fair value is considered ineffective hedging 
and recorded in net foreign exchange gains and losses  For hedge on customer 
contracts, upon recognition of the hedged net sales, the cumulative amount 
in hedging reserve is released in the OCI as a reclassification adjustment and 
recognized in net sales  For hedge on business combination, the cumulative 
amount in hedge reserve is transferred as a basis adjustment to goodwill upon 
See note E1 “Equity” for movement in the cash flow hedge reserve  No 
hedge ineffectiveness was recognized in the income statement in 2023 
Credit risk is divided into three categories: credit risk in trade receivables and 
contract assets, customer finance risk and financial credit risk, see note A1 
Credit risk in trade receivables and contract assets
Credit risk in trade receivables and contract assets is governed by a policy 
applicable to all legal entities in the Company  The purpose of the policy is to: – Avoid credit losses through establishing internal standard credit approval 
routines in all the Company’s legal entities – Ensure monitoring and risk mitigation of defaulting accounts, i e  events 
of non-payment – Ensure efficient credit management within the Company and thereby 
improve days sales outstanding and cash flow – Define escalation path and approval process for customer credit limits 
The credit risk of all customers is regularly assessed  Through credit manage-
ment system functionality, credit checks are performed every time a sales order 
is generated in the source system  These are based on the credit limit and risk 
profile set on the customer  Credit blocks appear if credit limit is reached or if 
past due receivables are higher than permitted levels  Release of a credit block 
Letters of credits are used as a method for securing payments from custom-
ers operating in emerging markets, in particular in markets with unstable politi-
cal and or economic environments  By having banks confirming the letters of 
credit, the political and commercial credit risk exposures to the Company are 
Impairment of trade receivables and contract assets 
Trade receivables and contract assets are assessed for impairment under a 
unified model  The Company has determined that credit risk largely depends 
on both the risk in the country where the customer resides (e g  ability to make 
cross border payments) as well as the payment pattern of the customer  
Therefore, expected credit losses (ECLs) are calculated using a provision matrix 
that specifies a fixed rate depending both on the number of days past due and 
the country risk rating  The country risk ratings depend on the ratings used by 
all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD  The rates defined in the provision 
matrix are based on historical loss patterns for that grouping of customers  
These rates are adjusted for current conditions as well as management expec-
tations of changes to political risks and payment patterns in the future  The 
provision rates are higher on high risk countries compared to low risk countries 
and also higher on amounts that remain unpaid for longer periods of time  
The Company has assessed the recent global economic conditions on the 
expected credit losses model for trade receivables and updated the provision 
Trade receivables and contract assets, net of allowance, amounted to 
SEK 50,214 (58,256) million as of December 31, 2023  Provisions for expected 
credit losses on trade receivables and contract assets amounted to SEK 2,585 
(2,492) million as of December 31, 2023  Total past due more than 360 days 
has increased, resulting in a higher allowance as a percentage of gross expo-
sure at year end  The Company’s write-offs have historically been low  During 
the year SEK 35 (70) million were written off due to the Company having no 
Movements in allowances for impairment of trade receivables and contract assets 2023
The distribution of trade receivables and contract assets closely follows the 
distribution of the Company’s sales, see note B1 “Segment information ” The 
10 largest customers represented 47% (45%) of the total trade receivables 
Aging analysis of gross values of trade receivables and contracts assets by risk category
All major commitments to finance customers are made only after approval in 
accordance with the work procedure for the Board of Directors and according 
Prior to the approval of new facilities reported as customer finance, an 
internal credit risk assessment is conducted in order to assess the credit rating 
of each transaction for political and commercial risk  The credit risk analysis is 
made by using an assessment tool, where the political risk rating is identical to 
the rating used by all Export Credit Agencies within the OECD  The commercial 
risk is assessed by analyzing a large number of parameters, which may affect 
the level of the future commercial credit risk exposure  The output from the 
assessment tool for the credit rating also includes an internal pricing of the risk  
This is expressed as a risk margin per annum over the relevant base rate  The 
reference pricing for political and commercial risk, on which the tool is based, is 
reviewed using information from Export Credit Agencies and prevailing pricing 
in the bank loan and bond markets for structured financed deals  The objective 
is that the internally set risk margin shall reflect the assessed risk and that the 
pricing is as close as possible to the current market pricing  A reassessment of 
the credit rating for each customer finance facility is made on a regular basis  
As of December 31, 2023, the total amount payable to the Company 
under customer finance credits was SEK 9,681 (7,758) million  The carrying 
value of these assets was SEK 6,917 (5,370) million as of December 31, 
2023  Customer finance is arranged for infrastructure projects in different 
geographic markets  As of December 31, 2023, there were a total of 65 (73) 
customer finance arrangements originated by or guaranteed by the Company  
As of December 31, 2023, the five largest facilities, calculated based on gross 
exposure, represented 86% (74%) of the customer finance exposure  The 
geographical split of the year end gross exposure is as follows: South East Asia, 
Oceania and India 38% (18%), Middle East and Africa 22% (30%), Europe 
and Latin America 21% (27%) and North America 19% (24%)  As of December 
31, 2023, the Company also had unutilized customer finance commitments of 
Security arrangements for customer finance facilities may include pledges 
of equipment, pledges of certain assets belonging to the borrower and pledges 
of shares in the operating company  If available, third-party risk coverage is 
arranged  “Third-party risk coverage” means that a financial payment guaran-
tee covering the credit risk has been issued by a bank, an export credit agency 
or an insurance company  All such institutions have been rated at least invest-
ment grade  A credit risk transfer under a sub-participation arrangement with 
a bank can also be arranged  In this case the entire credit risk and the funding 
is taken care of by the bank for the part that they cover 
The table below summarizes the Company’s outstanding customer finance 
Outstanding customer ﬁnance credit risk exposure 1)
The Company’s risk exposure, less third-party risk 
1) This table shows the maximum exposure to credit risk  
Customer finance risk exposures are held at fair value and are classified 
as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy  The Credit Asset Management Team 
within Ericsson Credit AB, reporting to Head of Group Treasury and Customer 
Finance, has established a process with respect to measurement of fair values  
The quarterly credit review uses an internal model to determine a commercial 
rating for each credit and for calculation of the fair value  The model is based 
on external credit rating, political/country rating and bank pricing  Regular 
monitoring of customer behavior is also a part of the internal assessment  
Revaluation of customer finance (excluding effect of foreign exchange transla-
tion) amounted to a net loss in the consolidated income statement of SEK 209 
million in 2023 (loss of 15 million), of which net loss of SEK 209 million related 
to credits held as of December 31, 2023 (loss of 17 million)  This effect is pre-
Due to the 5G buildout, the demand for customer financing arrangements has 
continued to increase significantly  Most of such financing arrangements have 
Financial instruments carry an element of risk in that counterparts may 
be unable to fulfill their payment obligations  This exposure arises in the 
investments in cash, cash equivalents, interest-bearing securities and from 
derivative positions with positive unrealized results against banks and other 
The Company mitigates these risks by investing cash primarily in high rated 
securities such as treasury bills, government bonds, commercial papers, and 
mortgage-covered bonds (see Liquidity risk section below)  Separate credit 
limits are assigned to each counterpart in order to minimize risk concentration  
All derivative transactions are covered by ISDA netting agreements to reduce 
the credit risk  For cross-currency derivatives a Credit Support Annex (CSA) 
to ISDA is signed to further reduce the credit risk by exchanging collateral 
weekly against market value  The Company has also moved some derivative exposures to clearing counterparties with daily settlement of margins 
At December 31, 2023, the credit risk in financial cash instruments was 
equal to the instruments’ carrying value  The expected credit losses on cash 
equivalents and interest-bearings securities classified as amortized cost were 
immaterial  Credit exposure in derivative instruments was SEK 0 4 (0 8) billion 
The Company minimizes the liquidity risk by maintaining a sufficient cash 
position, centralized cash management, investments in highly liquid interest-
bearing securities, and by having sufficient committed credit lines in place to 
meet potential funding needs  For information about contractual obligations, 
analyzed by contractual maturity, see note D4 “Contractual obligations ” The 
short-term commitment on debt in the next 12 months are sufficiently covered 
by cash and other interest-bearing assets at year end  Ongoing collection from 
customers are expected to satisfy operational requirements including trade 
payables and other purchase obligations  Commitments for new customer 
finance is not expected to have negative short-term effect on collection as 
majority are sold within a short period  Where required, the Company expects 
short-term borrowing facilities to be drawn down or rolled over to meet liquid-

Refinancing risk is the risk that the Company is unable to refinance outstand-
ing debt under reasonable terms and conditions, or at all, at a given point in 
time  The Company mitigates the risk by having diversified funding sources 
through a mix of bonds, bilateral loans and private placements, with a 
spread of debt maturing over time  The funding strategy is flexible to enable 
pre-financing before loan maturities and funding in various currencies  The 
average maturity of long-term borrowings is 3 7 years (3 8 years) at December 
31, 2023  In addition to the long-term funding programs, the Company has a 
commercial paper program and a committed liquidity revolving credit facility 
Euro Medium Term Note program (USD million) 5,000 2,842 2,158 
1) There are no ﬁnancial covenants related to these programs 
In November 2023, the Company issued a 4 5-year EUR 500 million green 
bond under the Euro Medium Term Note program and Green Financing 
Framework  During the year, the Company established a new committed 
liquidity revolving credit facility of USD 1 0 billion, of which USD 0 4 billion was 
utilized as at year end, and increased the borrowings under the commercial 
paper program by SEK 2 0 billion  Furthermore, the Company signed two 
7-year loan agreements, one with European Investment Bank for USD 273 
million and one with Nordic Investment Bank for USD 107 million

In September 2023, the Company exercised the second and the last one-year 
extension option on the USD 2 billion sustainability-linked revolving credit 
facility  The facility does not have interest rates linked to credit rating or finan-
cial covenants but is linked to two of Ericsson’s sustainability KPIs 
Fair valuation of the Company’s ﬁnancial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments accounted for at fair value generally 
meet the requirements of level 1 valuation as they are based on quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets  For some of the Company’s financial 
assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not readily available and fair values are calculated using market inputs such as interest 
For financial liabilities designated at fair value to profit and loss, the carry-
ing amount reflects the effect in own credit spreads either in quoted prices or 
quoted Credit Default Swap (CDS) for Investment Grade companies 
Assets and liabilities are classified as level 1 if their value is observable in an 
active market  Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted 
prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price 
is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring 
– Valuation technique using observable inputs – level 2
Assets and liabilities classified as level 2 have been valued using models whose 
inputs are observable either directly or indirectly  Valuations based on observ-
able inputs include cash equivalents (e g  discounted papers, term deposits) and 
interest rate derivatives which are valued using interest rate yield curves  Other 
market observable inputs include credit spreads and FX forward rates  Inputs for 
base interest rates are quoted fixing rates, interest rates swaps and IBOR rates  
FX derivatives are valued by using observable forward rates, discounted 
using base interest rate curve  Valuation of foreign exchange options are 
made using the Black-Scholes formula  The value of credit risks in derivative 
contracts are monitored regularly  Derivative credit and debit valuations 
adjustments are calculated based on outstanding market values and default 
probabilities from the CDS market, and if effect on valuation is material, are 
– Valuation technique using signiﬁcant unobservable inputs – level 3
Assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 if their valuation incorporates 
significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable 
inputs)  Apart from trade receivables and customer finance receivables, this 
valuation technique mainly applies to investment in shares and other partici-
pations whereby valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly 
observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling exter-
nal evidence demonstrating an executable exit price  Using a market approach 
to valuation, unobservable inputs are generally determined via reference to 
observable inputs, historical observations or other analytical techniques 
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value of other ﬁnancial asset Investment in shares 
1) Table shows net gains or losses recognized in Other operating income or expenses, of which SEK 186 
million unrealized loss relate to Level 3 assets held at the end of the year  
Financial instruments, such as some cash equivalents, interest-bearing securi-
ties, borrowings and payables, are carried at amortized cost which is deemed 
to be equal to fair value  When a market price is not readily available and there 
is insignificant interest rate exposure and credit spreads affecting the value, the 
carrying value is considered to represent a reasonable estimate of fair value 
From January 1, 2023, liquidity portfolios in some subsidiaries are managed 
on a fair value basis, therefore deposits (cash equivalents) held in these port-
folios are reclassified as fair value through profit or loss (previously classified 
as amortized cost)  The fair value of assets reclassified from amortized cost

To secure long-term funding, the Company uses notes and bond programs 
together with bilateral research and development loans, as well as private 
placements  All outstanding notes and bond loans are issued by the Parent 
Company under its Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) program  Bonds issued at 
a fixed interest rate are normally swapped to a floating interest rate using inter-
est rate swaps under the Asset and liability management mandate described 
in note F1 “Financial risk management ” In addition to the long-term funding 
programs, the Company has a commercial paper program and a committed 
liquidity revolving credit facility to efficiently manage liquidity needs, further 
described in note F1 “Refinancing risk ” Total weighted average interest rate 
cost for parent company funding during the year was 5 15% (2 45%) 
The global economy continues to face multiple challenges due to geopoliti-
cal uncertainty and the threat of economic downturn affecting all major econo-
mies  Central banks across the world have raised interest rates in response 
to inflation  The higher short-term interest rates increased interest payments 
on long-term borrowings as fixed coupons payments are normally swapped 
to floating rates  As all long-term borrowings are also denominated in either 
USD or Euro, interest payments and cost of borrowings in SEK have increased 
Ericsson sponsors a number of post-employment benefit plans throughout the 
Company, which are in line with market practice in each country  
The Company has updated the assumptions used to value the defined ben-
efit pension liabilities based on the latest market conditions  Financial assump-
tion changes resulted in net actuarial gains on defined benefit obligations of 
SEK 0 9 billion although this was largely offset by changes in demographic 
Sweden has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans based on 
collective agreement between the parties in the Swedish labor market: – A defined benefit plan, known as ITP 2 (occupational pension for salaried 
employees in manufacturing industries and trade), complemented by 
a defined contribution plan, known as ITPK (supplementary retirement benefits)  This is a final salary-based plan  – A defined contribution plan, known as ITP 1, for employees born in 1979 
or later  – A defined contribution plan ITP 1 or alternative ITP, for employees earning 
more than 10 income base amount and who have opted out of the defined 
benefit plan ITP 2, where rules are set by the Company and approved by 
The Company has by far most of its Swedish pension liabilities under defined 
benefit plans which according to IAS 19 is funded to 59% (57%) by the assets 
of Ericsson Pensionsstiftelse (a Swedish Pension Foundation)  These liabilities, 
if valued using different methodology and assumptions established by the 
Swedish PRI Pensionsgaranti, are considered funded to more than 100% by 
the assets of Ericsson Pensionsstiftelse  There are no funding requirements for 
The disability and survivors’ pension part of the ITP-plan is secured through 
an insurance solution with the company Alecta, see section about Multi-
The Company pays benefit directly to the pensioners as the obligations fall 
due  The responsibility for governance of the plans and the plan assets lies with 
the Company and the Pensionsstiftelse  The Swedish Pensionsstiftelse is man-
aged on the basis of a capital preservation strategy and the risk profile is set 
accordingly  Traditional asset-liability matching (ALM) studies are undertaken 
on a regular basis to allocate within different asset classes 
The plans are exposed to various risks, e g , a sudden decrease in the bond 
yields, which would lead to an increase in the plan liability  A sudden instability 
in the financial market might also lead to a decrease in fair value of plan assets 
held by the Pensionsstiftelse, as the holdings of plan assets partly are exposed 
to equity markets; however, this may be partly offset by higher values in fixed 
income holdings  Swedish plans are linked to inflation and higher inflation will 
As before, the Company has secured the disability and survivors’ pension part 
of the ITP Plan through an insurance solution with the insurance company 
Alecta  Although this part of the plan is classified as a multi-employer defined 
benefit plan, it is not possible to get sufficient information to apply defined 
benefit accounting, as for most of the accrued pension benefits in Alecta, 
information is missing on the allocation of earnings process between employ-
ers  Full vesting is instead registered on the last employer  Alecta is not able to 
calculate a breakdown of assets and provisions for each respective employer, 
and therefore, the disability and survivors’ pension portion of the ITP Plan has 
Alecta has a collective funding ratio which acts as a buffer for its insurance 
commitments to protect against fluctuations in investment return and insur-
ance risks  Alecta’s collective funding ratio ranges from 125% to 175% and 
reflects the market value of Alecta’s plan assets as a percentage of its commit-
ments to policy holders (both guaranteed and non-guaranteed), measured 
in accordance with Alecta’s actuarial assumptions, which are different from 
those in IAS 19  Alecta’s collective funding ratio was 158% (172%) as of 
December 31, 2023  The Company’s share of Alecta’s saving premiums is 0 4% 
and the total share of active members in Alecta is 2 1%  The expected contribu-
Contingent liabilities / Assets pledged as collateral
Contingent liabilities include the Company’s mutual responsibility as a credit 
insured company of PRI Pensionsgaranti in Sweden  This mutual responsibility 
can only be imposed in the instance that PRI Pensionsgaranti has consumed 
all of its assets, and it amounts to a maximum of 2% of the Company’s pen-
sion liability in Sweden  The Company has a pledged business mortgage of 
SEK 7 4 billion to PRI Pensionsgaranti at year end  PRI continuously measures 
the Company credit risk levels according to the credit insurance terms and 
The Company operates both defined contribution and defined benefit pension 
plans in the US, which are a combination of final salary pension plans and 
contribution-based arrangements  The final salary pension plans provide 
benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for 
life  The level of benefits provided depends on members’ length of service and 
their salary in the final years leading up to retirement  Retirees generally do not 
The other type of plan is a contribution-based pension plan, which provides 
a benefit determined using a “cash balance” approach  The balance is credited 
monthly with interest credits and contribution credits, based on a combination 
The majority of benefit payments are from trustee-administered funds; 
however, there are also a number of unfunded plans where the Company 
meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due  In the US, the Company’s 
policy is at least to meet or exceed the funding requirements of federal regula-
tions  The funded level in the US Pension Plan is above the point at which 
minimum funding would be required for fiscal year 2023 
Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practice, 
as is the nature of the relationship between the Company and the trustees (or 
equivalent) and their composition  Responsibility for governance of the plans, 
including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies with the Plan 
Administrative Committee (PAC)  The PAC is composed of representatives 
The Company’s plans are exposed to various risks associated with pen-
sion plans, i e , a sudden decrease in bond yields would lead to an increase 
in the present value of the defined benefit obligation  A sudden instability in 
the financial markets might also lead to a decrease in the fair value of plan 
assets held by the trust  Pension benefits in the US are not linked to inflation; 
however, higher inflation poses the risk of increased final salaries being used to 
determine benefits for active employees  There is also a risk that the duration 
of payments to retirees will exceed the life expectancy in mortality tables 
The Company operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans in 
the UK  All defined benefit plans in the UK are closed to future pension accrual 
The defined benefit plans provide benefits to members in the form of a 
guaranteed level of pension payable for life  The level of benefits provided is 
defined by the Trust Deed & Rules and depends on members’ length of service 
and their salary  Pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the UK 
retail price index, subject to caps defined by the rules 
The plans’ assets are held in trusts and are invested in a diverse range of 
assets  The plans are governed by local regulations and responsibility for the 
governance of the plans lies with the Trustee Directors, who are appointed by 
the Company from its employees and from the plans’ members  Independent 
professional trustees sit on a number of the Boards 
The plans remain exposed to various risks associated with defined benefit 
plans, e g  a decrease in bond yields or increase in inflation would lead to an 
increase in the present value of the defined benefit obligation  Alternatively, 
the duration of payments to retirees could exceed the life expectancy assumed

Accounting treatment of Long-Term Variable Compensation Programs
In note A1” Material accounting policies”, the overall accounting policies for 
share-based payments within the Company are disclosed  In summary: – Share-settled programs, the total compensation expense is calculated 
based on the fair value (FV) at grant date and recognized over the service 
period of three years  – Cash-settled plans, the accounting principles are the same as for any other 
accruals or provisions  Prior to payout an accrual or provision is recognized 
every period based on the present period’s best estimate of the total 
amount  Any difference between total payout and the sum of accruals 
or provisions is recognized in the income statement in the period of final 
All long-term variable compensation programs have been designed to form 
a part of a well-balanced total remuneration package and in general to span 
over a minimum of three years (service period)  As these are variable compen-
sation programs, the outcomes cannot be predicted when the programs are 
introduced and rewards depend on long-term personal commitment, corpo-

ticipants, provided that certain performance conditions are met, to receive a 
number of shares, free of charge, following expiration of a three-year vesting 
period (vesting period)  Allotment of shares pursuant to Performance Share 
Awards are subject to the achievement of performance criteria which are 
defined specific to each year’s program when the program is introduced  
Which portion, if any, of the Performance Share Awards for LTV will vest is 
determined at the end of the relevant performance period based on the satis-
faction of the predetermined performance criteria for that year’s LTV program 
(performance period)  The performance criteria for the currently running 
LTV and EPP are summarized in the below table along with the satisfaction 
1) The portion of the Performance Share Awards granted to a participant based on the relative TSR performance condition is subject to fulﬁlment of the related performance criteria over the performance period 
compared to Peer Groups consisting of 11 companies for the program year 2023, 2022, 2021 and 2020  The vesting of the Performance Share Awards under this performance condition will vary depending on the 
Company’s TSR performance ranking versus the other companies in the peer group at the end of the performance period  
2) Excludes restructuring charges and items not included in target performance criterion 
4) Excludes ﬁnes and similar related to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) / U S  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) resolution, including payments required pursuant to the DOJ Plea Agreement

made to the President and CEO was 190% of the annual base salary, and for 
other participants ranged between 30% and 70% of the participants’ respec-
tive annual base salaries at the time of grant  The share price used to calculate 
the number of shares to which the Performance Share Awards entitles was 
calculated as the volume weighted average of the market price of Ericsson B 
shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately fol-

strengthen Ericsson’s commitment to long-term sustainability and responsible 
business  Hence again a one-year Group operating income (EBITA) target 
measured over the period January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was included 
as a performance condition for LTV 2023 in addition to the standard three-year 
total shareholder return (TSR) performance conditions, which were also used 
for LTV 2022, LTV 2021 and LTV 2020 however with different weights

relative TSR development for the Ericsson B share over the period January 1, 
2023 to December 31, 2025 (the performance period)  The criteria related to 
ESG are split into two sub-components: reducing carbon dioxide equivalent 
(“CO2e”) emissions in the Ericsson Group’s own activities and increasing the 
representation of women leaders in the Ericsson Group  The ESG performance 
criteria are being measured over the period January 1, 2023 to December 31,

No new EPP plan was issued in 2023 as the eligible executives were offered 
the LTV 2023 share granted and vested Plan  The running Executive 
Performance Plans (EPP) continue to run over the performance period until 
The Executive Performance Plan (EPP) is a cash-settled plan which uses the 
same performance criteria as the ones under the respective year’s long-term 
Senior managers, except for the members of the ET, are selected as partici-
pants to EPP annually through a nomination process that identifies individuals 
according to performance, potential, critical skills, and business critical roles 
There are two award levels, high and regular, which represent the potential 
award levels as a percentage of the participant’s annual gross salary, which 
are determined separately by the Board of Directors for each year’s plan before 
the plan is launched  Participants are assigned a potential award, which is 
converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market price 
of Ericsson B shares used for the respective year’s LTV  The three-year vesting 
period is the same as for the LTV  The vesting level of the award is subject to 
the achievement of the same performance criteria over the same performance 
period defined for the respective year and generally requires that the partici-
pant retains his or her employment over the vesting period  
At the end of the vesting period, the allotted synthetic shares are converted 
into a cash amount, based on the market price of Ericsson B shares at Nasdaq 
Stockholm at the vesting date, and this final amount is paid to the participant in 
165 senior managers were selected to participate in EPP 2022  The regular 
award level is set at 15% and the high award level is set at 25% for all countries 
except for the USA/Canada  The regular and high award levels are set at 35% 
159 senior managers were selected to participate in EPP 2021  The regular 
award level is set at 15% and the high award level is set at 25% for all countries

The KC Plan is a cash-settled retention plan  Employees, except for senior 
managers and the members of the ET, are selected as participants to KC Plan 
annually through a nomination process that identifies individuals according to 
performance, potential, critical skills, and business critical roles  Participants are 
assigned a potential award based on a percentage of their annual gross salary, 
which is converted into a number of synthetic shares based on the same market 
price of Ericsson B shares used for the respective year’s LTV 
The KC Plan is a retention plan, therefore there are no performance criteria 
for vesting of awards  In general, there is a three-year service period for receiv-
ing the award in full and the award is subject only to continued employment 
during the service period  As of the KC 2019 plan the total service period is three 
years, however the payout is distributed over the entire service period with 
staggered payments according to the below schedule: – 25% of the award to be paid at the end of the first year, – 25% of the award to be paid at the end of the second year, and – the remaining 50% of the award to be paid at the end of the third year 
Accounting wise, the plans with three staggered payments are seen as three 
separate tranches  The tranches are accounted for as separate awards and 
accrued in parallel with the same grant date but different vesting dates  The 
consequence of the staggered payments is a front-end loaded cost for these 
plans  The accounting model is referred to as staged vesting 
The value of each synthetic share is driven by the absolute share price 
performance of Ericsson B shares during the service period  At the end of the 
service period, the allotted synthetic shares are converted into a cash amount, 
based on the market price of Ericsson B shares Nasdaq Stockholm at the vest-
ing date, and this final amount is paid to the participant in cash gross before 
10,154 employees were selected to participate in KC Plan 2023  There are at 
multiple levels between 10%–50% of the participants’ annual gross salary

Ericsson is committed to helping employees thrive and to recognizing them 
for the impact they create by providing opportunities to enrich their working 
experience  In order to encourage employees to play an active role in achieving 
the Company’s purpose, further create sense of belonging and ownership, the 
new Ericsson share purchase plan was launched in November 2021  At the 
end of 2023 the plan is implemented in 77 countries to approximately 77,700 
The ESPP is an all-employee share purchase plan that enables employees 
to purchase Ericsson B-shares up to a maximum value of SEK 50,000 per year 
via monthly payroll deduction  In recognition of the employees’ commitment, 
Ericsson supports the participants with a net cash payment up to 15% of their

Prior to taking office as President and CEO of Ericsson, Board member Börje 
Ekholm entered into an option agreement in 2016 with Investor AB and AB 
Industrivärden, shareholders of Ericsson  Each of these two shareholders has 
issued 1,000,000 call options to Börje Ekholm on market terms (valuation 
conducted, using the Black & Scholes model, by an independent third party)  
Under the agreements, Börje Ekholm has purchased in total 2,000,000 call 
options, issued by the shareholders, for a purchase price of SEK 0 49 per call 
option  Each call option entitles the purchase of one Ericsson Class B share 
from the shareholders at a strike price of SEK 80 per share (to be recalculated 
to neutralize the effects of dividend payments during the option period) 
after a seven-year period  The exercise period is one year with the possibility 
to be extended for up to one year in the event that the holder is unable to 
exercise the option during the exercise period due to a regulatory restriction 
or prohibition  Due to the fact that the call options were purchased on market 
terms as described above, no compensation expense has been recognized by 
the Company during the option period and will not be recognized during the 
In 2019, Investor AB, shareholder of Ericsson, made an offer to the Board 
Chairs of its listed core investment to purchase call options relating to shares in 
the respective core investment  Following this offer, Ronnie Leten, the former 
Chair of the Board of Directors, entered into such a call option agreement with 
Investor AB with respect to Ericsson Class B shares  Under the agreement, 
Investor AB has issued 128,452 call options to Ronnie Leten on market terms 
(valuation conducted, using the Black & Scholes model, by an independent 
third party) and Ronnie Leten has purchased these call options for a purchase 
price of SEK 15 57 per call option  Each call option entitles the purchase of one 
Ericsson Class B share from Investor AB at a strike price of SEK 87 97 per share 
(to be recalculated to neutralize the effects of dividend payments during the 
option period) after a four-year period starting February 5, 2019  The exercise 
period is one year with the possibility to be extended for up to one year in 
the event that the holder is unable to exercise the option during the exercise 
period due to a regulatory restriction or prohibition  Due to the fact that the call 
options were purchased on market terms as described above, no compensa-
tion expense has been recognized by the Company during the option period 
and will not be recognized during the remaining part of the exercise period 
The compensation expense for the share-settled plans is based on FV and 
the number of shares  The FV for the LTV programs includes adjustments for 
absolute and relative TSR development performance criteria at the grant date, 
using a Monte Carlo model, which uses a number of inputs, including expected 
dividends, expected share price volatility and the expected period to exercise  
The performance criteria of the LTV program are also based on the outcome of 
the Group operating income (EBITA) as per fiscal year 2023 and Group operat-
ing income (EBIT) as per fiscal years 2022 and 2021  The FV for the Group 
operating income (EBITA and EBIT) performance criteria is calculated as the 
share price at grant date, reduced by the net present value of the dividend

Ericsson’s annual general meeting on March 29, 2023 authorized the 
Company’s board of directors to resolve on the transfer of the Company’s own 
shares  Under the authorization the Company may, in conjunction with the 
delivery of vested shares under the long-term variable compensation programs 
2019 and 2020 (“LTV 2019” and “LTV 2020”), prior to the annual general 
meeting in 2024, decide to retain and sell no more than 60% of the vested 
shares of series B in the Company in order to cover for the costs for withholding 
and paying tax and social security liabilities on behalf of the participants in 
relation to the performance share awards for remittance to revenue authorities

The financial statements of the Parent Company, Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act 
and RFR 2 “Reporting in separate financial statements ” RFR 2 requires the 
Parent Company to use the same accounting principles as for the Group, i e , 
The main deviations between accounting policies adopted for the Group 
and accounting policies for the Parent Company are:
Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures 
The investments are accounted for according to the acquisition cost method  
Investments are carried at cost and only dividends are accounted for in the 
income statement  An annual impairment test for the investments in each subsidiary company is performed in the fourth quarter, or when there is an indi-
cation of impairment  An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount 
of an investment exceeds the sum of the subsidiary’s equity and related good-
will, intangible liabilities and deferred tax liabilities or its estimated future cash 
flows after tax  Cash flows are discounted to present value using an after-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 
Contributions to/from subsidiaries and shareholders’ contributions 
are accounted for according to RFR 2  Contributions from/to Swedish subsidi-
aries are reported net in the income statement  Shareholders’ contributions 
Classiﬁcation and measurement of ﬁnancial instruments
IFRS 9 “Financial instruments” is adopted, except regarding financial guar-
antees and revaluation of borrowings due to change in credit risk  Financial 
guarantees are included in Contingent liabilities according the exception 
allowed in RFR 2  Revaluation of borrowings due to change in credit risk are 
Leases are reported according to the exception allowed in RFR 2  For leases 
where the Parent Company is lessee this means that the right-of-use assets 
and liabilities are not recognized on the balance sheet  Costs under the lease 
are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease  Lease incentives received are recognized as an integral part of 
the total lease expense, over the term of the lease  For leases where the Parent 
Company is lessor, the equipment is recorded as property, plant and equipment 
and revenue as well as depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term  Expenses related to the lease income are recognized when 
incurred  Direct expenses incurred when a lease agreement is entered are 
added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and expensed over the lease 
The accounting of untaxed reserves in the balance sheet results in different 
accounting of deferred taxes as compared to the principles applied in the con-
solidated statements  Swedish GAAP and tax regulations require a company to 
report certain differences between the tax basis and book value as an untaxed 
reserve in the balance sheet of the standalone financial statements  Changes 
to these reserves are reported as an addition to, or withdrawal from, untaxed 
Pensions are accounted for according to the simplification rule in RFR 2  The 
pension obligation is secured with transferring of funds to a pension trust  A net 
pension obligation is only accounted for to the extent that the fair value of the 
trust is lower than the pension obligation  According to RFR 2, disclosures from 
Transaction costs attributable to the acquisition are included in the cost 
of acquisition in the Parent Company statements compared to Group Statements where these costs are expensed as incurred 
See notes to the consolidated financial statements – note A2 “Critical account-
ing estimates and judgments ” Major critical accounting estimates and judg-
ments applicable to the Parent Company include trade and customer finance

A number of new amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet 
effective for the year ended December 31, 2023, and have not been applied 
in preparing the Parent Company financial statements  The IASB has issued 
amendments with effective date January 1, 2024, relating to “IAS 1 Presenta-
tion of financial statements”, “IFRS 16 Leases”, “IAS 7 Statement of Cash 
Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments”  The amendments are not estimated 
to have a material impact and there are no additions or exceptions allowed in 
RFR 2  Among the amendments issued by IASB with effective date January 1, 
2025, are “Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange 
Rates: Lack of Exchangeability ” There are no additions or exceptions in RFR2 
relating to this amendment and it is not expected to have any material impact, 
but to consider is the already existing rule in RFR 2 regarding reporting cur-
rency  For the changes in IFRS standards, more details can be found in the

1) In 2023 write-downs of investments in subsidiary companies were made by SEK 32 8 (2 2) billion, whereof SEK 31 9 billion was related to the investment in Vonage  The reason for the write-down of the invest-
ment in Vonage was mainly macroeconomic headwinds, including rising interest rates and changing demand trends  Other write-downs were mainly a result of devaluation of currency and lowered expectation 
on future proﬁtability for a few entities  For impairment test in 2023 of investments in subsidiary and associated companies a discount rate of 11 0% (9 0%) was applied  For high inﬂation countries individual dis-
count rates ( 12 0-24 0%) were applied  At the time of the write-downs the recognized amounts in the balance sheet related to each impacted subsidiary company were equal to value in use or equity value of the

All the information in this Annual Report and in particular the risks 
and uncertainties outlined below should be carefully considered  
Based on the information currently known to the Company, Ericsson 
believes that the following section identifies the most significant 
risks affecting its business  Any of the factors described below, or 
any other risk factors discussed elsewhere in this report, could have 
a material negative effect on strategic objectives, business, opera-
tions, future performance, revenues, operating and after-tax results, 
profit margins, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, credit rating, 
market share, reputation, brand and or its share price  Additional 
risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that 
Ericsson currently believes to be immaterial may also materially 
adversely affect its business  Furthermore, Ericsson’s operating 
results may have a greater variability than in the past and Ericsson 
may have difficulties in accurately predicting future developments  
1 1 Ongoing geopolitical and trade uncertainty from a range of 
factors may have a material adverse impact on Ericsson’s business, 
Geopolitical alliances are shifting as global tensions, including between 
US and China over trade, influence and the status of Taiwan, drive 
growing economic, technological, military, and political competition 
across the world  At the same time, there are numerous ongoing local 
and regional conflicts, including the ongoing military conflicts between 
Ukraine and Russia and in the broader Middle East  While the ultimate 
impact of these dynamic tensions is unclear, the uncertainty they create 
is expected to continue  These geopolitical developments, including 
trade or security restrictions and export controls, enhanced sanctions 
measures, vendor consolidation, and increased safeguards for national 
security purposes, can impact global market conditions, including 
market share, access and position  The current environment continues to 
be challenging for global supply chains in general and ICT supply chains 
in particular, while also increasing costs  These uncertainties include the 
effects of trade disputes and other political tensions involving, among 
others, the governments of the European Union, the US, China, India, 
There are particular uncertainties for the future bilateral trading 
relationship between China and a number of countries as a result of the 
restrictions imposed on Chinese vendors or components in 5G networks 
that have been adopted in many countries, and access to hardware 
and software products and components may be constrained  Of special 
relevance for Ericsson in this context is the trade relationship between 
Sweden and China  Although Ericsson is a global company with a global 
presence, it has its headquarters in Sweden and therefore risks being 
affected by any deterioration of the Swedish-Chinese relationship  In 
addition, the Company has business operations in China, and further 
changes in economic and political policies in or relating to China could 
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business  During the 
last few years, Ericsson has observed sustained challenges to the global 
free trade system, including towards the World Trade Organization 
(WTO) dispute settlement body  Any increased prospect of government 
policies and actions violating WTO agreements could negatively impact 
Ericsson’s ability to benefit from open markets and free trade  
The mandated or otherwise required localization of manufactur-
ing and R&D or use of local suppliers or production, as well as their 
digital counterparts (including data localization of IT-infrastructure 
and restrictions on data flows), has been steadily growing, motivated 
by protectionism, indigenous industrial policies and national security 
concerns  Geopolitical uncertainty has led to reduced efficiency in R&D, 
including restrictions on use of R&D resources, and opportunities to 
scale or grow with increasing logistical and administrative burdens, 
while polarization of the industry and fragmentation of global standards 
continues to develop (e g , O-RAN)  There is a risk of moves away from 
global value chains and towards more regional or national alternatives  
Governments may continue to impose conditions that require the use of 
local suppliers and local production or partnerships with local compa-
nies for R&D and IT-infrastructure, require the license or other transfer 
of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local busi-
nesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse 
impact on Ericsson’s ability to pursue a business globally  
Additionally, political instability, strict requirements on localization 
of data, manufacturing and R&D, or use of local suppliers or production 
in the regions in which the Company operates may further increase the 
risk of possible legal or regulatory violations by Ericsson or its employ-
ees  Any violation by Ericsson or its employees could cause severe 
reputational harm to the Company and have a material adverse effect 
on Ericsson’s business operations and result in government actions 
and the imposition of significant financial penalties and restrictions on 
the Company’s ability to do business, including with certain customers, 
such as government bodies or those in certain regulated sectors (e g  
The continually evolving global geopolitical situation has had and 
will continue to have consequences for the entire ICT industry, with the 
possibility of further industry splits, separation of global value chains 
and separation of global standards for mobile telecommunications  
These developments have also led to several countries evaluating how 
to ensure uninterrupted access to telecommunication network infra-
structure, for example through promoting disaggregation of the Radio 
105 Risks related to business activities and industry
118 Environmental, social and business conduct risks
Access Network and support of national communication network infra-
structure champions as alternatives to the established global vendors 
such as Ericsson, although the timing and extent of this remains unclear 
All of the above may have a material and potentially lasting adverse 
impact on Ericsson’s international product development and global sup-
ply chains and necessitate a flexible and adaptive organizational setup, 
therefore impacting its profitability and business as a whole  
1 2 Challenging global economic conditions may adversely impact 
the demand, cost and pricing for Ericsson’s products and services as 
Challenging global economic conditions, including due to downturns 
in the global economy, political unrest and uncertainty, labor and sup-
ply shortages, increasing inflation and rising interest rates or a period 
of elevated interest rates, health epidemics, or geopolitical risks and 
trade frictions may have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand 
for Ericsson’s products and for the products and services of Ericsson’s 
customers  This could cause operators and other customers to postpone 
investments or initiate other cost-cutting measures to maintain or 
improve their financial position  This could, in turn, result in signifi-
cantly reduced expenditures for the Company’s products and services, 
including network infrastructure  This reduced demand for products 
and services could result in increased price competition or deferrals of 
purchases, leading to lower revenues not fully offset by reduced costs  
Reduced demand could also result in excess and obsolete inventories 
and excess manufacturing capacity, which would have an adverse 
Some operators and other customers, in particular in markets with 
weak currencies, may encounter funding difficulties and slower traffic 
development, which may negatively affect their investment plans and 
cause them to purchase fewer of the Company’s products and services  
Increased inflation may impact the Company’s cost base through 
increased costs of labor and supply of material, products and services  
Ericsson is particularly exposed to these risks in certain key geographies 
where its largest customers are located, such as the United States and 
India  It may not be possible to fully compensate for such increased 
costs through increased sales prices to the Company’s customers, lead-
ing to lower margins and decreased financial performance  Challenging 
macroeconomic conditions could also lead to financial difficulties or 
failures among Ericsson’s customers or suppliers, increased demand for 
customer finance, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable and an 
Macroeconomic volatility can also lead to increased difficulties in 
forecasting sales and financial results, as well as increased volatility 
in Ericsson’s reported results and potential impairment losses related 
to Ericsson’s intangible assets as a result of lower forecasted sales of 
certain products  Should any of the foregoing factors persist or worsen, 
the adverse impacts on Ericsson’s business and financial condition could 
1 3 Ericsson’s business depends upon the continued growth of 
mobile communications and the success of Ericsson’s existing and 
targeted customer base, which can impact customer demand, as well 
A substantial portion of Ericsson’s business depends on the continued 
growth of mobile communications in terms of both the number of sub-
scriptions and usage per subscriber, which in turn drives the continued 
deployment and expansion of network systems by Ericsson’s customers  
If communications service providers fail to increase the number of 
subscribers and or usage does not increase, or if they fail to capitalize 
on opportunities created through technological evolution, Ericsson’s 
business and operating results could be materially adversely affected  
If communications service providers fail to monetize services, fail to 
adapt their business models or experience a decline in their revenues or 
profitability, their willingness to further invest in their existing and new 
networks may decrease, which will reduce their demand for Ericsson’s 
products and services and have an adverse effect on the Company’s 
business, operating results, and financial condition  
During 2023, macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary 
pressures, were more challenging than expected, which has led to 
reduced volumes and pace of investment by many of Ericsson’s custom-
ers  The timing and magnitude of market recovery, particularly in North 
America, has been slower than expected  There can be no assurance as 
to when levels of market investment will recover  Traffic development on 
cellular networks could be further affected if more traffic is offloaded to 
WI-FI networks, which would have profound effects on operator voice/
broadband/SMS revenues with possible reduced capital expenditures 
as a consequence  Additionally, new technologies such as satellite could 
be further developed and launched  Ericsson’s strategy depends on the 
development and success of global standards  This could be adversely 
affected in the future by industry forces more interested in de-facto 
standards or geopolitical forces leading to fragmentation of standards 
and increased difficulties in creating economies of scale 
Fixed and mobile networks converge and new technologies, such 
as IP and broadband, enable communications service providers to 
deliver services in both fixed and mobile networks  Ericsson is depend-
ent on the uptake of such services and the outcome of regulatory and 
standardization activities such as spectrum allocation  Delays in uptake, 
standardization or regulation could adversely affect Ericsson’s business, 
In addition, Ericsson’s sales volumes and gross margin levels can 
be reduced by an unfavorable mix and order time of Ericsson’s prod-
ucts and services  Ericsson’s sales to operators and other customers 
represent a mix of equipment, software and services, which normally 
generate different gross margins  The operators still represent the main 
part of Ericsson’s business and are also the focus for sales going for-
ward  Ericsson provides all of the Company’s customers with solutions 
based on Ericsson’s own products as well as third-party products, which 
normally have lower margins than Ericsson’s own products  As a con-
sequence, Ericsson’s reported gross margin in a specific period will be 
affected by the overall mix of products and services as well as the rela-
tive content of third-party products  In the Company’s Cloud Software 
and Services and Other segments, third-party products and services rep-
resent a larger portion of Ericsson’s business than the Company’s tradi-
tional sales, which impact Ericsson’s business models  Further, network 
expansions and upgrades have much shorter lead times for delivery 
than initial network build outs  Orders for such network expansions and 
upgrades are normally placed on a short notice by customers, often less 
than a month in advance, and, consequently, variations in demand are 
difficult to forecast  As a result, changes in Ericsson’s product and service 
mix and the short order time for certain of Ericsson’s products may affect 
Ericsson’s ability to accurately forecast sales and margins or detect in 
advance whether actual results will deviate from market consensus 
and expectations  Product and delivery lead times of certain products 
may be prolonged due to the potentially restricted market availability of 
certain components caused by supply chain delays  Short-term variation 
could have a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operating 
1 4 Ericsson may not be successful in implementing its key 
strategies, including improving profitability, capturing 5G market 
opportunities, capitalizing on the GNP and Enterprise opportunity, 
or achieving expected benefits from restructuring activities 
There can be no assurance that Ericsson will be able to successfully 
implement its strategy to achieve future profitability, growth or create 
shareholder value  When deemed necessary, Ericsson has undertaken 
and expects to continue to undertake specific restructuring or cost- 
saving initiatives; however, there are no guarantees that such initiatives 
will be sufficient, successful or executed in time to deliver improvements 
in Ericsson’s earnings  Furthermore, this Annual Report includes certain 
estimates with respect to addressable markets as well as with respect 
to growth rates in the operating segments in which Ericsson operates, 
including Networks, Cloud Software and Services, Enterprise and Other  
If the underlying assumptions on which the Company’s estimates are 
based prove not to be accurate, the actual performance or addressable 
markets and CAGR may be materially different from the estimates pre-
Ericsson’s 5G market opportunity will depend on availability of 
attractive spectrum for 5G, and time of spectrum allocations, amount 
of spectrum, type of frequency bands such as low bands (below 1 GHz), 
mid-bands (3–6 GHz) and high bands (above 24 GHz), as well as terms 
of spectrum licenses, such as cost and license period of time, may not be 
according to needs and plans, which could delay or reduce the 5G mar-
ket  In addition, the operator usage of this spectrum could be restricted 
by regulatory authorities for shorter or longer time and in different 
geographical areas, due to unforeseen circumstances such as interfer-
ence with other electronic equipment at sensitive locations, e g  airports  
The Company cannot guarantee that it will not become the subject of 
related liability claims (such as product liability or claims associated with 
the configuration or installation of equipment), all of which could have a 
material adverse impact on Ericsson’s business and reputation 
Operator speed and scale to adopt 5G could also be changed due 
to market conditions, including resolution of M&A transactions as well 
as government incentives to deploy 5G  Operator 5G deployment plans 
could also be delayed by operational issues such as site access, permits, 
availability of installation crews  There is also a risk that the scale and 
time of 5G deployments will change due to the availability of 5G devices, 
not only for launch but also due to the speed with which device prices 
will decline to drive mass market adoption  The timing, size and technol-
ogy choices of market opportunities beyond enhanced mobile broad-
band, such as fixed wireline access, industrial IoT and private networks, 
may materialize differently than estimated  Ericsson or its suppliers may 
encounter unforeseen technical challenges that can affect Ericsson’s 
Ericsson’s future growth is partly dependent on enterprises in several 
industries that are digitalizing and increasingly utilizing cellular wireless 
solutions (including Private Cellular Networks), as well as increasingly 
utilizing and offering automated services, which are growth drivers 
for GNP  Ericsson can provide no assurance regarding the timing or 
magnitude of growth of its GNP  Competing technologies, such as 
Wi-Fi, macroeconomic headwinds, and customers’ unwillingness to pay 
for services might slow down this development  Legal and regulatory 
restrictions such as Net neutrality can also slow down or restrict global 
expansion of this business  Furthermore, access to devices, sensors, and 
spectrum might also impact the pace and ability for enterprises to adopt 
cellular wireless technology  In addition, as described in Risk Factor 3 3 
below, Vonage and Ericsson are engaged in a remediation process relat-
ing to ongoing compliance with obligations under the National Security 
Agreement (NSA) entered into in connection with Ericsson’s acquisition 
of Vonage  The ongoing compliance efforts and related remediation 
may adversely affect the Vonage business, including changes required 
to business structure and additional compliance costs  
Furthermore, the Company may not achieve some or all of the 
expected benefits of its restructuring activities, and the Company’s 
restructuring may adversely affect its business  Restructuring activities 
may be costly and disruptive to Ericsson’s business, and Ericsson may 
not be able to achieve and retain the cost savings and benefits that were 
initially anticipated  Additionally, restructuring activities can result in a 
loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and or inefficiency 
during transitional periods  Reorganization and restructuring can 
require a significant amount of management and other employees’ 
time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing 
Ericsson’s business  Restructuring activities can create unanticipated 
consequences and negative impacts on the business, such as Ericsson’s 
ability to develop, sell and deliver its products and services, and there 
is no assurance that any ongoing or future restructuring efforts will be 
successful or generate expected cost savings  Factors that may impede 
a successful implementation include the retention of key employees, the 
impact of regulatory matters, and adverse market and macroeconomic 
conditions  If Ericsson fails to achieve some or all of the expected ben-
efits of its restructuring initiatives, the Company’s competitive position, 
business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, reputation 
1 5 Ericsson engages in acquisitions and divestments that may be 
disruptive and require the Company to incur significant expenses, 
and Ericsson may not be successful in consummating such transac-
tions, protecting the value of acquisitions during integration, or 
creating the value anticipated from the acquisition  
In addition to in-house innovation efforts, Ericsson makes acquisitions 
to obtain various benefits, such as reduced time-to-market, access to 
technology and competence, increased scale or a broadened product 
portfolio or customer base  Recent examples are the acquisitions of 
Vonage and Cradlepoint  Acquisitions could result in the incurrence of 
material contingent liabilities or an increase in amortization expenses 
related to intangible assets or impairment of goodwill, which could have 
a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operating results, finan-
cial condition and liquidity  Ericsson has recorded impairment charges 
related to acquisitions in the past, including a non-cash impairment 
charge of SEK 31 9 billion in the third quarter of 2023 related to goodwill 
and other intangible assets attributed to Vonage and may record addi-
tional impairment charges in future  Further risks Ericsson could face 
with respect to acquisitions include: – Inability to consummate acquisitions that it considers important to 
the future of its business  – Underperformance of the acquired company, failure to realize 
expected benefits and synergies and or inability to deliver on antici-
pated business plans to the extent or in the timeframe anticipated  – Insufficiencies of technologies and products acquired, including 
unexpected quality problems  – Difficulties in the full or partial integration of the operations, tech-
nologies, products and personnel of the acquired company to mate-
rialize expected synergies or to maintain independent operations in 
these companies at a risk appropriate level  – Risks of entering markets in which the Company has no or limited 
prior experience, or in creating such market or eco-system as envi-
sioned in e g , the Vonage and Cradlepoint examples  
– Potential loss of key employees  – Diversion of management’s attention away from other business 
concerns  – Risks and expenses of any disclosed, undisclosed or potential legal 
liabilities of or other adverse financial impacts on the acquired 
company, including failure to comply with laws or regulations or 
other requirements or conditions, e g , from foreign direct investment 
reviews and decisions such as the Committee on Foreign Investment 
in the United States (CFIUS) review process  See Risk Factor 3 3 for 
further information related to the CFIUS review process 
From time to time, Ericsson also divests parts of its business to opti-
mize the Company’s product portfolio or operations  Any decision to 
dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of 
special charges, such as workforce reduction costs and industry- and 
technology-related write-downs  Risks Ericsson could face with respect 
to divestments include: – Difficulties in the separation of the operations, technologies, products 
and personnel of the business divested  – Potential loss of key employees  – Impairment losses or write-downs of the carrying value of the rel-
evant assets  – Expenses of any undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of the busi-
The risks associated with acquisitions and divestments could have a 
material adverse effect upon Ericsson’s business, operating results, 
1 6 Ericsson has entered into Joint Venture (JV) and partnership 
arrangements, and in the future may enter into additional JV or 
partnership arrangements, which may not be successful and could 
Ericsson’s JV and partnership arrangements may fail to perform as 
expected for various reasons, including an incorrect assessment of the 
Company’s needs and synergies, an inability to take action without the 
approval of Ericsson’s partners, difficulties in implementing business 
plans, or the lack of capabilities or financial instability of the Company’s 
strategic partners  Ericsson’s ability to work with these partners or 
develop new products and solutions, e g , as part of Ericsson’s 5G 
portfolio, may become constrained, which could harm the Company’s 
competitive position in the market  In addition, any adverse regulatory, 
governmental or authority decision towards a partner could negatively 
impact Ericsson or the JV, and Ericsson’s brand or reputation could also 
be harmed if a partner does not adhere to Ericsson’s Code of Conduct for 
Business Partners, including compliance rules  Additionally, Ericsson’s 
share of any losses from or commitments to contribute additional capital 
or borrowings to such JV and partnership arrangements may adversely 
affect Ericsson’s business, operating results, financial condition and cash 
1 7 Ericsson may not be able to properly respond to market trends 
in the industries in which it operates, including virtualization of 
network functions and fluctuations in investments in the telecom-
Ericsson is affected by market conditions and trends in the industries in 
which the Company operates, including the convergence of the IT and 
telecommunications industries  Technological developments largely 
drive convergences enabling digitalization and a move from dedicated 
hardware to software and cloud-based services  This also includes 
a disaggregation of the Radio Access Network, although the timing 
and extent of this remains unclear  This is changing the competitive 
landscape of Ericsson’s business as well as value chains and business 
models and affects Ericsson’s objective-setting, risk assessment and 
strategies  The change makes access to market easier for new competi-
tors, including new competitors to Ericsson’s business that have entered 
and may continue to enter the market, and negatively impacts Ericsson’s 
market share in selected areas  If Ericsson fails to understand or antici-
pate market trends and developments or fails to acquire the necessary 
competencies to develop and sell products, services and solutions that 
are competitive in this changing business environment, the Company’s 
business, operating results and financial condition will suffer  
The telecommunications industry has historically experienced down-
turns in which operators substantially reduced their capital spending 
on new equipment  Uncertainty surrounding global economic growth 
and geopolitical impacts may materially harm actual market conditions, 
which could have a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business  
Moreover, market conditions are subject to substantial fluctuation and 
could vary geographically and across technologies  Uncertainties can 
have an impact on both the CAPEX driven market as well as the OPEX 
market, e g , Managed Services  Ericsson’s strategy is based on an 
expansion towards the Enterprise segment, which is a market that is 
more affected by the overall economic conditions than the operator mar-
kets  Even if global conditions improve, conditions in the specific industry 
segments in which the Company participates could be weaker than in 
other segments  In that case, the Company’s revenue and operating 
results may be adversely affected  If capital expenditures by operators 
and other customers are weaker than anticipated, the Company’s rev-
enues, operating results and profitability may be adversely affected  The 
level of demand from operators and other customers who buy Ericsson’s 
products and services can vary over short periods of time, including from 
month to month  Due to the uncertainty and variations in the telecom-
munication industry, as well as in the ICT industry, accurately forecast-
ing revenues, results, and cash flow remains difficult 
With 5G volume at scale shifting from early 5G markets into markets 
with higher volatility and as Ericsson is establishing business relation-
ship with new customers, the levels of uncertainty and fluctuation 
can increase going forward  For example, both sales and profit can be 
impacted due to a significant variation in underlying market and or 
product and services mix  Furthermore, Ericsson might fail to anticipate 
customer demand properly, leading to an over or under supply of com-
ponents, production capacity and deployment capabilities 
1 8 Ericsson faces intense competition from the Company’s exist-
ing competitors as well as new entrants, including vendor consolida-
The markets in which Ericsson operates are highly competitive in terms 
of price, functionality, service quality, customization, timing of develop-
ment, and the introduction of new products and services  The Company 
faces intense competition from significant competitors, many of which 
are very large companies, with substantial technological and financial 
resources and established relationships with operators  Additionally, 
Ericsson faces competition from more diverse vendors, many of which 
are better able to cross-subsidize  Ericsson’s operator customers, which 
represent the main part of Ericsson’s business, are also large and highly 
sophisticated and exercise significant buying power through the com-
mon use of a competitive bidding process  Ericsson also encounters 
increased competition from new market entrants and alternative 
technologies as industry standards evolve  In addition, if Ericsson 
chooses to enter a new market segment, it might underestimate the 
skills and practices of the relevant competitors  The Company’s competi-
tors may implement new technologies before Ericsson does, offer more 
attractively priced or enhanced products, services or solutions, or offer 
other incentives that Ericsson does not provide  Some of the Company’s 
competitors may also have greater resources in certain business seg-
ments or geographic areas than Ericsson does  Increased competition, 
and the crystallization of any of the risks above, could result in reduced 
profit margins, loss of market share and increased research and devel-
opment costs, as well as increased sales and marketing expenses, which 
could have a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operating 
Additionally, Ericsson operates in markets in which the technology 
and the manner in which it is being brought to market is rapidly chang-
ing  This has resulted and may continue to result in continuous price 
pressure on Ericsson’s products and services, especially in light of global 
macroeconomic uncertainty  If Ericsson’s counter measures, including 
enhanced products and business models or end-to-end cost reductions, 
cannot be achieved or do not occur in a timely manner, there could be 
adverse impacts on Ericsson’s business, operating results, financial 
condition and market share  In addition, vendor consolidation may lead 
to stronger competitors who are able to benefit from integration, scale 
and greater resources, which could increase competition in Ericsson’s 
market  Industry convergence and consolidation among equipment and 
services suppliers could potentially result in stronger competitors that 
are competing as end-to-end suppliers, as well as competitors more 
specialized in particular areas, which could, for example, impact certain 
of Ericsson’s segments such as Cloud Software and Services and Other  
If established actors in adjacent markets acquire players with new tech-
nologies in Ericsson’s markets, new strong competitors could emerge  
Consolidation may also result in competitors with greater resources 
and market position than Ericsson has  Both of these events could have 
a materially adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operating results, 
1 9 Ericsson relies on a limited number of third-party suppliers, 
Ericsson’s ability to deliver according to market demands and contrac-
tual commitments depends significantly on obtaining a timely and 
adequate supply of materials, components, production capacity, R&D 
and IT services, and other vital services on competitive terms, including 
from single-source suppliers in some instances, or in the case of the 
development and supply of, for example, key ASIC and FPGA compo-
nents, printed circuit boards, standard electronics or semiconductors 
(including foundry node availability) from very few suppliers, on which 
Ericsson depends  Some of these suppliers have very limited geographi-
cal redundancy, making them vulnerable to natural disasters, macro-
economic impacts, conflicts or other potentially disruptive events  Due 
to the current tensions between the US and China as well as China and 
Taiwan, this risk has increased  In addition, for certain suppliers Ericsson 
faces risks related to continued supplier concentration  
Accordingly, there is a risk that the Company will be unable to 
obtain key supplies it needs to produce Ericsson’s products and provide 
Ericsson’s services on commercially reasonable terms, in time, or at all  
This is particularly critical in connection with large projects like the cur-
rent 5G rollout in India  Failure by the Company or any of the Company’s 
suppliers could delay or interrupt Ericsson’s products or services supply 
or operations and significantly limit sales or increase Ericsson’s costs, 
for example through damages  In the event of a supply chain disruption, 
it may take significant time to find an alternative supplier or redesign 
products to replace components, which could cause significant delays 
or interruptions in the delivery of Ericsson’s products and services and 
result in a reduction in sales  Ericsson has, from time to time, experi-
enced interruptions of supply, and the Company may experience such 
interruptions in the future, which could hamper Ericsson’s ability to 
procure adequate supplies at commercially reasonable prices, or at all  
Furthermore, the Company’s procurement of supplies requires 
Ericsson to predict future customer demands  If Ericsson fails to antici-
pate customer demand properly, an over or under supply of components 
and production capacity could occur  In many cases, some of Ericsson’s 
competitors utilize the same manufacturers, and if they have purchased 
capacity ahead of Ericsson, the Company could be blocked from 
acquiring the needed products  This factor could limit Ericsson’s ability 
to supply its customers and increase costs  At the same time, Ericsson 
commits to certain capacity levels or component quantities, which, if 
unused, will result in charges for unused capacity, unrecoverable costs or 
the scrapping of costs used to procure such components  The Company 
is also exposed to financial counterpart risks to suppliers when Ericsson 
pays in advance for supplies  Such supply disruptions and cost increases 
may negatively affect the Company’s business, operating results and 
1 10 A significant portion of Ericsson’s revenue is currently gener-
ated from large, multi-year agreements with a limited number of 
key customers, and operator consolidation may increase Ericsson’s 
Ericsson derives most of its business from large, multi-year agreements 
with a limited number of significant customers, many of whom are 
concentrated by industry or product  Many of these agreements are 
reviewed on a yearly basis to renegotiate the price for Ericsson’s products 
and services and do not contain committed purchase volumes and may 
include commitments to future price reductions, requiring the Company 
to constantly manage and control its cost base  However, there can be 
no assurance that Ericsson’s actions to reduce costs, particularly with 
increasing inflation and interest rates, will be sufficient or quick enough 
to maintain the Company’s gross margin in such contracts, which may 
have a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operating results 
and financial condition  In 2023, Ericsson’s largest customer represented 
approximately 8% of the Company’s net sales, and its ten largest custom-
ers accounted for 43% of net sales  A loss of or a reduced role with a key 
customer could have a significant adverse impact on sales, profit and 
market share for an extended period  This concentration also subjects 
Ericsson to increased risks regarding the quality of the contractual 
arrangements it has in place with key customers  In addition, Ericsson’s 
dependence on the sales of certain of Ericsson’s products and services 
may have a significant adverse impact on sales, profit and market share  
If the Company’s customers’ financial conditions deteriorate, Ericsson 
will be exposed to increased credit and commercial risks  Challenging 
financial conditions have impacted some of Ericsson’s customers’ ability 
to pay their invoices, and the Company may encounter difficulty col-
lecting accounts receivables and could be exposed to risks associated 
with uncollectable accounts receivable  Ericsson has also experienced 
demand for customer financing, and in adverse financial markets or 
more competitive environments for the customers, those demands may 
increase  Upon the financial failure of a customer, the Company may 
experience losses on credit extended and loans made to such customer, 
losses relating to Ericsson’s commercial risk exposure, and the loss of the 
customer’s ongoing business  If customers fail to meet their obligations 
to us, the Company may experience reduced cash flows and experience 
losses in excess of reserves, which could have a material adverse effect 
In addition, during the past decade, communications service providers 
have undergone significant consolidation, resulting in fewer operators 
with activities in several countries  This trend is expected to continue 
due to competitive pressure  A market with fewer and larger operators 
will increase Ericsson’s reliance on key customers and may negatively 
impact Ericsson’s bargaining position and profit margins  Moreover, if the 
combined companies operate in the same geographic areas, networks 
may be shared, and less network equipment and fewer associated 
services may be required  Network investments could be delayed by the 
consolidation process, which may include, among others, actions relat-
ing to merger or acquisition agreements, securing necessary regulatory 
approvals, or integration of businesses  Network operators also share 
parts of their network infrastructure through cooperation agreements 
rather than legal consolidations, which may adversely affect demand 
for network equipment  Accordingly, operator consolidation may have a 
material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operating results, market 
In addition, some of the communications service providers may 
become more willing to partner with hyperscalers to build and run the 
telecom’s access networks  Ericsson risks having more complex rela-
tions wherein new relationships with its customers or competitors could 
appear, e g , Ericsson’s customers could also become its competitors by 
selling telecommunications cloud solutions to operators, or Ericsson’s 
competitors could also become its partners when its software would 
potentially run on their hardware run-time environment  Moreover, com-
munications service providers including Ericsson’s key customers may be 
adversely impacted by new competition, especially in rural mobile broad-
band growth affected by the emerging competition from the greenfield 
satellite broadband sector  Accordingly, Ericsson’s business may experi-
ence a material adverse effect, including impacts on Ericsson’s operating 
sales, operating results, market share and financial condition 
Product, solution or service quality issues could lead to reduced 
revenue and gross margins and declining sales to existing and new 
customers, as well as penalties, claims or damages  Sales contracts 
normally include warranty undertakings for faulty products and often 
include provisions regarding penalties and or termination rights in the 
event of a failure to deliver ordered products or services on time or with 
required quality, possibly also for damages incurred on customer busi-
nesses  Ericsson’s quality assurance measures may be unable to prevent 
certain issues related to reliability, product and service quality, security, 
privacy or service performance, which may negatively affect Ericsson’s 
reputation, business, operating results and financial condition  This could 
also include poor quality of AI-based solutions, or third-party products 
that are part of Ericsson’s solutions  If significant warranty obligations 
arise due to reliability, security, privacy or quality issues with Ericsson’s 
products, solutions or services, Ericsson’s operating results, reputation 
and financial position could be negatively impacted by costs associated 
with fixing software or hardware defects, including replacement, high 
service and warranty expenses, high inventory obsolescence expense, 
adapting or creating a replacement service, delays in collecting accounts 
receivable or declining sales to existing and new customers 
1 11 Ericsson may not be successful in maintaining technology 
leadership, including developing new products and enhancements 
Ericsson depends upon the development of new products and enhance-
ments to the Company’s existing products, and the success of Ericsson’s 
substantial research and development investments is uncertain  Rapid 
technology and market changes in Ericsson’s industry require the 
Company to make significant investments in research and develop-
ment to be innovative  Ericsson invests significantly in new technology, 
products and solutions, e g  related to 5G, machine learning, and AI  
To be successful, those technologies, products and solutions must 
often be accepted by relevant standardization bodies and or by the 
industries and markets as a whole  The failure of Ericsson’s research 
and development efforts to be technically or commercially successful 
could have adverse effects on Ericsson’s business, operating results and 
financial condition  If Ericsson invests in the development of technolo-
gies, products and solutions that do not function as expected, are not 
adopted by the industry, are not ready in time, or are not successful in 
the marketplace, the Company’s sales and earnings may materially 
suffer  Additionally, it is common for research and development projects 
to encounter delays due to changing requirements and unforeseen 
problems  Delays in production and research and development may 
increase the cost of research and development efforts and put Ericsson 
at a disadvantage compared to Ericsson’s competitors  These could 
have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, customer 
relationships, operating results and financial condition 
 Ericsson may be unable to meet its Cloud Software and Services 
business objectives, and several risks related to market, technology and 
operations can impact the plan  5G market development and subscriber 
growth, as well as the uptake of cloud native technologies and conse-
quent adoption of Ericsson’s new offerings, and automated delivery and 
life-cycle-management of the products can be slower than expected  
Increased competition from both emerging and established competitors 
may impact Ericsson’s market position  The Company could be too slow 
to adapt to and adopt new technologies like AI and machine learning to 
drive more automation in products, solutions and services  The trans-
formation to the cloud native solutions that 5G core standards are built 
on could also include greater complexity and take longer than expected  
In addition, the increasing influence of open-source initiatives could 
drive a best of breed approach in Ericsson’s customers, driving prices 
down and adversely impact the Company’s full suite of offerings  For 
managed services, most contracts span more than one year, with a long 
sales cycle for new contracts  Risk of termination and reduced scope or 
renegotiation of existing contracts may have a negative impact on sales 
and earnings  In the operational dimension, Ericsson may be unable to 
successfully execute on continued end-to-end efficiency measures to 
simplify the operating model, as well as being unable to mitigate risks 
in the customer projects, which could have a material adverse effect on 
Ericsson incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in certain 
of its products and services and in its business operations  The research 
and development of such technology remains ongoing  AI presents 
risks, challenges, and unintended consequences that could affect 
Ericsson’s and its customers’ adoption and use of this technology  AI 
algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed  Additionally, 
AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and the Company 
faces significant competition in the market and from other compa-
nies regarding these technologies  Ericsson may be unsuccessful in 
identifying or resolving AI-related ethical and legal issues before they 
arise  Regulation of AI technology is nascent and rapidly changing, 
complicating both compliance and development efforts  AI-related 
issues, deficiencies and or failures could give rise to legal and or regula-
tory action, including with respect to proposed legislation regulating AI 
in certain jurisdictions, such as the European Union, which evolves from 
time to time, and as a result of new applications of existing data protec-
tion regulation, which could damage Ericsson’s reputation or otherwise 
1 12 Ericsson’s ability to benefit from intellectual property rights 
(IPRs), which are critical to the Company’s business, may be limited 
by changes in regulation relating to patents, inability to prevent 
infringement, the loss of licenses to or from third parties, infringe-
ment claims brought against the Company by competitors and 
others and changes in the area of open standards when it comes to 
There can be no assurance that the Company’s patents will not be 
challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that any rights granted 
in relation to Ericsson’s patents will in fact provide the Company with 
Ericsson’s use of a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality poli-
cies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, in addition to 
relying on patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect Ericsson’s 
IPRs, may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other 
misappropriation  In addition, Ericsson relies on many software patents, 
and limitations on the patentability of software may materially affect 
Moreover, the Company may not be able to detect unauthorized use 
or take appropriate and timely steps to establish and enforce Ericsson’s 
proprietary rights  In fact, existing legal systems of some countries in 
which Ericsson conducts business offer limited, if any, protection of IPRs  
The Company’s solutions may also require it to license technologies from 
third parties  It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses, 
and there can be no assurance that they will be available on acceptable 
terms, or at all  Moreover, the inclusion in Ericsson’s products of software 
or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a non-
exclusive basis could limit the Company’s ability to protect proprietary 
Many key aspects of telecommunications and data network technol-
ogy are governed by industry-wide standards usable by all market 
participants  As the number of market entrants and the complexity of 
technology increases, the possibility of functional overlap and inadvert-
ent infringement of IPRs also increases, which has been the case with 
the introduction of 5G technology  In addition to industry-wide stand-
ards, other key industry-wide software solutions are currently developed 
by market participants as free and open-source software  Contributing 
to the development and distribution of software developed as free and 
open-source software may limit Ericsson’s ability to enforce applicable 
patents in the future  Third parties have asserted, and may assert in the 
future, claims, directly against Ericsson or against Ericsson’s custom-
ers, alleging infringement of their IPRs  Defending such claims may be 
expensive, time-consuming and divert the efforts of Ericsson’s manage-
ment and or technical personnel  As a result of litigation, Ericsson could 
be required to pay damages and other compensation directly or to 
indemnify Ericsson’s customers for such damages and other compensa-
tion, develop non-infringing products/technology or enter into royalty 
or licensing agreements  However, the Company cannot be certain that 
such licenses will be available to the Company on commercially reason-
able terms or at all, and such judgments could have a material adverse 
effect on Ericsson’s business, reputation, operating results and financial 
condition  Using free and open-source software may allow third parties 
to further investigate the Company’s software due to the accessibility of 
source code  This may in turn make this software more prone to asser-
Investigations held by antitrust authorities, court judgments and 
legislative change could potentially affect Ericsson’s ability to benefit 
from its patent portfolio when licensing patents necessary to conduct an 
open standard (e g  4G and 5G technology), which could have a material 
adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, reputation, operating results and 
financial condition  Ericsson holds a leading patent portfolio in open 
standards and possible changes regarding such a portfolio may materi-
ally affect Ericsson’s reputation, business, operating results and financial 
Ericsson’s ability to benefit from IPRs may be limited by the loss of 
patent licenses to or from third parties  Patent licensing agreements 
are generally multi-year and term based and the process for renewal of 
these licenses normally requires negotiations, particularly in conjunc-
tion with technology shifts and the introduction of new standards, 
such as 5G  Such renewals and negotiations may take time to resolve, 
sometimes involve litigation and may have material adverse impacts 
on Ericsson’s business and financial position, including on the timing for 
and level of revenues from the IPR licensing contract portfolio 
Challenging global economic conditions and political unrest and 
uncertainty, geopolitical risks and trade frictions may increase the 
uncertainty around the direction of the global cellular eco-systems and 
standards, which could have adverse effects on Ericsson’s IPR licensing 
revenues as well as on the ability to acquire licenses 
1 13 Ericsson may not be successful in continuing to attract 
and retain the highly qualified employees necessary to remain 
Ericsson believes that the Company’s future success largely depends 
on Ericsson’s continued ability to hire, develop, motivate and retain 
engineers and other qualified employees who develop successful new 
products/solutions, support Ericsson’s existing product range and 
provide services to the Company’s customers and create great customer 
Competition for highly qualified people in the industries in which the 
Company operates remains intense  This competition is only further 
increased by the fact that other industries are looking for similar talent  
The Company’s ability to succeed depends in part on maintaining a 
favorable corporate reputation that can be adversely impacted by many 
factors, including ongoing litigation, investigations, and adverse media 
reports  There are no guarantees that Ericsson will be successful in 
attracting and retaining employees with the right skills in the future, and 
failure in retaining and recruiting could have a material adverse effect on 
1 14 Unforeseen risks and disruptions, whether due to natural or 
man-made events, may be highly damaging to the operation of 
Ericsson’s operations are complex, and several critical operations are 
centralized in a single location  The Company’s business operations and 
those of its suppliers and customers are vulnerable to interruption by fire, 
earthquake, hurricane, flood or other natural disasters, power loss, secu-
rity incidents, systems failure, telecommunications failure, pandemics, 
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines, national catastrophes, 
terrorist activities, war and other events beyond the Company’s control  
If any disaster were to occur, Ericsson’s or its suppliers’ and customers’ 
ability to operate could be seriously impaired, and Ericsson could 
experience material harm to its business, operating results and financial 
Having outsourced significant portions of Ericsson’s operations, such 
as parts of IT, finance and HR operations, Ericsson depends on the per-
formance of external companies, including their security and reliability 
measures  Regardless of protection measures, systems and communica-
tions networks are susceptible to disruption due to failure, vandalism, 
security incidents, natural disasters, power outages and other events  
Ericsson also has a concentration of operations on certain sites, includ-
ing R&D, production, manufacturing, workforce concentrated areas, 
network operation centers, ICT centers and logistic centers and shared 
services centers, where business interruptions could cause material 
damage and costs  In addition, these disasters could significantly 
disrupt Ericsson’s business by, among other things, reducing demand 
for its products and services, impairing its customers’ ability to purchase 
or pay for its products or services, delaying or preventing its suppliers 
from providing the Company with critical components, damaging or 
destroying inventory, preventing operators from upgrading their wireless 
networks to meet new technology standards, or preventing a significant 
number of its employees, including those who perform critical functions, 
from performing their duties  Interruptions to Ericsson’s systems and 
communications may have an adverse effect on the Company’s opera-
Furthermore, employees and sub-contractors may be put at risk 
in areas where Ericsson operates due to these unforeseen risks and 
disruptions  Ericsson’s commitment to bring connectivity to the world 
involves operations in areas of high risk related to local conflicts, war-
fare, criminality, authoritarian rule, man-made accidents or naturally 
caused crises, such as flooding, earthquakes, tsunamis or other natural 
disasters  Such situations may risk the lives or welfare of employees, 
subcontractors’ employees, or their families, as well as trigger liabilities 
under International Humanitarian Law  Ericsson’s internal frameworks, 
contractual agreements, protective measures, and emergency response 
plans may not be enough to protect employees or subcontractors’ 
employees from harm  If Ericsson is found to not have done enough to 
provide protection or support in such situations, it could have adverse 
material effects on its business and reputation and can lead to litigation 
2 1 Ericsson’s debt increases the Company’s vulnerability to 
general adverse economic and industry conditions, limits Ericsson’s 
ability to borrow additional funds, and may limit the Company’s flex-
ibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in Ericsson’s business 
As of December 31, 2023, Ericsson’s outstanding debt was SEK 46 9 
billion and the Company is rated investment grade by S&P Global 
(BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB-) and one step below investment grade 
by Moody’s (Ba1)  This degree of debt and the credit ratings could have 
important adverse consequences, including: – Increasing Ericsson’s vulnerability to general economic and industry 
conditions  – Requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be 
dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on the Company’s 
indebtedness, thereby reducing Ericsson’s ability to use its cash flow 
to fund the Company’s operations, capital expenditures and future 
business opportunities  – Restricting Ericsson from making strategic acquisitions or causing 
Ericsson to make non-strategic divestitures  – Limiting Ericsson’s ability to obtain additional financing for adjusted 
working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, 
acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  – Limiting the Company’s ability to adjust to changing market condi-
tions and placing Ericsson at a competitive disadvantage compared 
Ericsson may choose to incur substantial additional indebtedness in 
the future  If new indebtedness is added to the Company’s current 
debt levels, the related risks that Ericsson now faces could increase  If 
Ericsson’s financial performance were to deteriorate, the Company may 
not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of its indebtedness 
and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy Ericsson’s obligations 
under the Company’s indebtedness, which may not be successful  
Ericsson’s ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance 
the Company’s debt obligations depends on its financial condition and 
operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and 
competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other 
factors beyond Ericsson’s control  If Ericsson’s financial performance 
were to deteriorate significantly, the Company might be unable to main-
tain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit 
Ericsson to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on Ericsson’s 
If, due to such a deterioration in the Company’s financial perfor-
mance, Ericsson’s cash flows and capital resources were to be insuf-
ficient to fund its debt service obligations, Ericsson may be forced to 
reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, 
seek additional capital or restructure or refinance Ericsson’s indebted-
ness  These alternative measures may not be successful and may not 
permit Ericsson to meet Ericsson’s scheduled debt service obligations  In 
addition, if the Company were required to raise additional capital in the 
current financial markets, the terms of such financing, if available, could 
result in higher costs and greater restrictions on its business  In addition, if Ericsson were to refinance its existing indebtedness, the 
conditions in the financial markets at that time could make it difficult to 
refinance Ericsson’s existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all  
If such alternative measures proved unsuccessful, Ericsson could face 
substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of mate-
rial assets or operations to meet the Company’s debt service and other 
Furthermore, Ericsson relies on various sources for short-term and 
long-term capital for the funding of the Company’s business  Should 
such capital become unavailable or available in insufficient amounts 
or on unreasonable terms, Ericsson’s business, financial condition and 
cash flow may materially suffer  Ericsson’s business requires a signifi-
cant amount of cash  If Ericsson does not generate sufficient amounts 
of capital to support the Company’s operations, service its debt and 
continue Ericsson’s research and development and customer finance 
programs, or if the Company cannot raise sufficient amounts of capital 
at the required times and on reasonable terms, Ericsson’s business, 
financial condition and cash flow are likely to be adversely affected  
Access to funding may decrease or become more expensive as a result of 
Ericsson’s operational and financial condition, market conditions, or due 
to deterioration in Ericsson’s credit rating  There can be no assurance 
that additional sources of funds that Ericsson may need from time to 
time will be available on reasonable terms or at all  If the Company can-
not access capital on a commercially viable basis, Ericsson’s business, 
financial condition and cash flow could materially suffer 
2 2 Due to having a significant portion of Ericsson’s costs in SEK 
and revenues in other currencies, the Company’s business is exposed 
to foreign exchange fluctuations that could negatively impact its 
Ericsson incurs a significant portion of the Company’s expenses in 
SEK  As a result of Ericsson’s international operations, Ericsson gener-
ates, and expects to continue to generate, a significant portion of the 
Company’s revenue in currencies other than SEK  To the extent Ericsson 
is unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid 
in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative 
impact on Ericsson’s consolidated income statement, balance sheet and 
cash flows when foreign currencies are exchanged or translated to SEK, 
As market prices are predominantly established in US dollars or 
Euros, Ericsson presently has a net revenue exposure in foreign curren-
cies, which means that a stronger SEK exchange rate would generally 
have a negative effect on Ericsson’s reported results  The Company’s 
attempts to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations through a 
variety of natural and financial hedging activities may not be sufficient 
or successful, resulting in an adverse impact on Ericsson’s results and 
2 3 Impairment of goodwill, other intangible assets, property 
and equipment (PP&E) and right-of-use (RoU) assets leased by the 
Company have impacted and may continue to negatively impact 
Ericsson’s financial condition and operating results  
Ericsson has a significant amount of these assets; for example, patents, 
customer relations, trademarks, software, PP&E and RoU  
Goodwill is the only intangible asset the Company has recognized to 
have an indefinite useful life  Other intangible assets are mainly amor-
tized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, and the 
assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events such as product 
discontinuances, product dispositions or other changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable  Those 
intangible assets not yet in use are tested for impairment annually  
Historically, the Company has recognized impairment charges mainly 
due to restructuring, which is usually limited, but occasionally signifi-
cant  Additional impairment charges may be incurred in the future and 
could be significant due to various reasons, including strategy changes, 
restructuring actions or adverse market conditions that are either 
specific to Ericsson or the broader industries in which Ericsson operates, 
or more general in nature and that could have an adverse effect on 
Ericsson’s operating results and financial condition  For example, in the 
third quarter of 2023, Ericsson recorded a non-cash impairment charge 
of SEK 31 9 billion related to goodwill and other intangible assets attrib-
uted to Vonage due to the significant drop in the market capitalization 
of Vonage’s publicly traded peers, increased interest rates and overall 
Negative deviations in actual cash flows compared to estimated cash 
flows as well as new estimates that indicate lower future cash flows 
might result in recognition of impairment charges  Other impairment 
indicators, such as the impact of increased interest rates, inflation, 
macroeconomic conditions, and other market events can also lead to 
the recognition of impairment charges  Non-cash impairment charges 
reduce the Company’s non-restricted equity  The impairment charge 
referred to above represented 50% of the total amount of goodwill 
and other intangible assets attributed to Vonage  The impairment was 
reported in segment Enterprise as an item affecting comparability  
Estimates require management judgment as well as the definition of 
cash-generating units for impairment testing purposes  Other judgments 
might result in significantly different results and may differ from the 
3 1 Ericsson could experience penalties and adverse rulings in 
enforcement or other proceedings, breach of contract claims and/
or loss of revenue for non-compliance with laws, rules and regula-
tions governing its business  Compliance with existing or changed 
laws, rules or regulations may subject Ericsson to increased costs or 
reduced products and services demand and may adversely affect 
Ericsson is subject to applicable laws, rules and regulations in multiple 
jurisdictions  The Company could experience penalties and adverse 
rulings in enforcement or other proceedings for non-compliance with 
applicable laws, rules or regulations governing its business, which could 
have a material adverse effect on Ericsson and its customers, including 
its reputation, business, financial condition, operations, research and 
development, operating results, cash flows, prospects or its current or 
future customer relationships, including both private and government 
customers  While Ericsson strives for compliance, the burden of monitor-
ing and maintaining compliance across global operations in a rapidly 
changing world and evolving industry is significant  The Company has 
not been in compliance with all such laws, rules and regulations in the 
past and cannot assure that all past violations have been addressed 
or that additional violations will not occur in the future  Ericsson’s 
non-compliance with laws, rules and regulations may also affect its 
customers’ compliance requirements and or lead to actual or perceived 
breach of Ericsson’s contractual obligations to its customers resulting in 
contract claims and loss of revenue  It may also impact Ericsson’s ability 
Further changes in laws, rules or regulations could subject Ericsson 
to liability, increased costs, or reduced products and services demand, 
market access restrictions, inability to deliver products of certain origin 
and have a material adverse effect on Ericsson, including its reputation, 
business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows or prospects  
Changes to laws, rules or regulations may adversely affect both 
Ericsson’s customers’ and the Company’s own operations  For example, 
regulations imposing more stringent, time-consuming or costly planning 
and zoning requirements or building approvals for radio base stations 
and other network infrastructure could adversely affect the timing and 
costs of network construction or expansion, and ultimately the commer-
cial launch and success of these networks  Similarly, tariff and roaming 
laws, regulations or rules on network neutrality could also affect com-
munications service providers ability or willingness to invest in network 
infrastructure, which in turn could affect the sales of Ericsson’s systems 
and services  Additionally, delay in radio frequency spectrum allocation, 
and allocation between different types of usage may adversely affect 
communications service provider spending or force Ericsson to develop 
new products to be able to compete  Furthermore, the rapid develop-
ment and deployment of tools that leverage AI is also causing govern-
ments to consider regulation of AI, even for AI that does not pertain to 
Further, Ericsson develops many of its products and services based 
on existing laws, rules, regulations and technical standards  Changes to 
existing laws, rules, regulations and technical standards, or the imple-
mentation of new laws, rules, regulations, restrictions and technical 
standards relating to products and services not previously regulated, 
could adversely affect Ericsson’s development or supply efforts by 
increasing compliance costs and causing delay or disruptions  Demand 
for those products and services could also decline  Regulatory changes 
related to e g  license fees, environment, health and safety, security, data 
localization, privacy (including the cross-border transfer of personal 
data for example between the EU and the US), and other regulatory 
areas may increase costs and restrict Ericsson’s operations or the 
operations of network operators  Also, indirect impacts of such changes 
and changes to laws, rules or regulations in other fields, such as pricing 
regulations, could have an adverse impact on Ericsson, even though the 
specific laws, rules or regulations may not apply directly to the Company 
3 2 Ericsson’s substantial international operations are subject to 
uncertainties that could affect the Company, including its reputa-
tion, business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows or 
Ericsson conducts business throughout the world and is subject to the 
effects of general global economic conditions as well as conditions 
unique to specific countries or regions  The Company has customers 
in more than 180 countries, with a significant proportion of Ericsson’s 
sales to emerging markets in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America, 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa  Ericsson’s extensive global 
operations subject the Company to additional risks on many fronts, 
including civil disturbances, acts of terrorism, acts of war, economic and 
geopolitical instability and conflict, potential misuse of technology lead-
ing to human rights violations, pandemics, the imposition of exchange 
controls, economies that are subject to significant fluctuations, nation-
alization of private assets or other governmental actions affecting the 
flow of goods and currency, effects from changing climate and difficulty 
of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through local legal 
Further, in certain markets in which Ericsson operates, there is a risk 
that national governments actively favor or establish local vendors or 
introduce requirements for local content in their respective markets at 
the expense of foreign competitors or introduce other requirements 
impacting how Ericsson can provide products and services to its cus-
tomers  The implementation of such measures could adversely affect 
Ericsson’s sales, Ericsson’s market share and its ability to purchase or 
Compliance with applicable export control regulations and sanc-
tions or other trade embargoes in force is paramount for the Company  
The geopolitical situation in parts of the world, particularly in Russia/
Ukraine, parts of the Middle East and China, remains uncertain, and 
the level of export controls and sanctions is still relatively high from a 
historical perspective  This level could even increase, thus significantly 
impacting Ericsson’s operations where such increase occurs, including 
in these markets  The most recent increase in export controls has par-
ticularly targeted China’s ability to develop advanced super computers 
and artificial intelligence, including the semiconductors needed for 
those operations  A universal element of the sanctions is the financial 
restrictions with respect to individuals and legal entities, but sanctions 
can also restrict certain exports and ultimately lead to a complete trade 
embargo towards a country  During the last few years, the global free 
trade system has been under sustained attack, which has increased 
the risk of states adopting policies and actions that violate WTO agree-
ments  Further, there is a risk in many countries of unexpected changes 
in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, price or 
exchange controls, restrictions of imports, or other governmental poli-
cies that could limit Ericsson’s operations and decrease Ericsson’s profit-
ability  Furthermore, export control regulations, sanctions or other forms 
of trade restrictions targeting countries in which Ericsson is active may 
result in a reduction of commitment in those countries  As an example, 
an escalation of trade tensions between the US and China has resulted 
in additional trade restrictions including export controls, and increased 
tariffs, which if further negatively developed could harm the Company’s 
ability to compete effectively in Chinese markets or with Chinese com-
panies and negatively impact Ericsson’s operations in the country  The 
need to terminate activities as a result of further trade restrictions may 
also expose Ericsson to customer claims and other inherent risks  The 
export control and sanctions laws, rules and regulations are complex, 
frequently changing and increasing in number; and the Company has 
not been in compliance with all such export control and sanctions rules 
or regulations in the past, and cannot assure that all past violations 
have been addressed or that additional violations will not occur in the 
future  Such violations could have material adverse effects on Ericsson, 
including its reputation, business, financial condition, operating results, 
cash flows, or prospects and could constitute a violation of the Plea 
Agreement (as defined below) or the consent judgment with the US 
Ericsson’s business operations are complex, involving the develop-
ment, production and delivery of telecommunications solutions to 
customers in a very large number of jurisdictions  Each jurisdiction has 
its own tax laws, rules and regulations subject to updates or changes in 
interpretation or enforcement, and the Company has to comply with the 
relevant laws, rules and regulations in each of these countries  These 
laws, rules and regulations involve income taxes and indirect taxes such 
as VAT and sales taxes as well as withholding taxes on domestic and 
cross border payments and social security charges related to Ericsson’s 
employees  Constant changes in the laws, rules or regulations and the 
interpretation thereof also create exposures regarding taxes  This results 
in complex tax issues and tax disputes that may lead to additional tax 
payment obligations  Being a global operation, Ericsson also faces the 
risk of being taxed for the same income in more than one jurisdiction 
(double taxation)  This could have adverse effects on Ericsson, includ-
ing its reputation, business, financial condition, operating results, cash 
There has been a concern reported by some media and others, that 
certain countries may use features of their telecommunications systems 
in ways that could result in actual or potential violation of human rights, 
among others  This may adversely affect the telecommunications busi-
ness and may have a negative impact for people and Ericsson  All of the 
above may have a material and potentially lasting adverse impact on 
Ericsson, including its reputation, business, including sales market share, 
market access, supply chain and R&D activities, financial condition, 
3 3 Ericsson is subject to certain US and other anti-corruption 
(including anti-bribery, anti-money-laundering, sanctions, terror 
finance and anti-terrorism) laws, rules and regulations and other 
regulatory requirements or conditions imposed as a result of foreign 
direct investment reviews and decisions  Ericsson may be subject to 
further adverse consequences under the Plea Agreement with the 
United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the injunction issued 
in connection with the 2019 settlement with the SEC, as well as other 
Ericsson is, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings and regula-
tory investigations, and is subject to certain other regulatory require-
ments, conditions and agreements  If any of these lawsuits or legal 
proceedings are determined unfavorably against the Company or it is 
determined that the Company is not in compliance with any of these 
regulatory requirements, conditions or agreements, the Company could 
be required to pay substantial damages, fines and or penalties, be sub-
ject to public scrutiny, negative reputational consequences, or become 
subject to additional enforcement actions, regulatory review and or 
adverse decisions  Ericsson could face potential debarment from gov-
ernment contracting in the United States and elsewhere, reputational 
risk, as well as potential counterparty reluctance to continue business 
relationships  In addition, these ongoing matters and investigations 
require significant resources and costs for investigation, compliance 
and remediation that could lead to adverse financial and reputational 
For example, in connection with the acquisition of Vonage by 
Ericsson, and as a condition to CFIUS’s approval of the acquisition, 
Vonage, Ericsson and the DOJ and the US Department of the Treasury, 
in their capacity as CFIUS monitoring agencies (CMAs), entered into a 
NSA in July 2022, which imposes restrictions on access to certain types 
of sensitive data, equipment and systems  Vonage and Ericsson are 
engaged and cooperating with the CMAs in relation to ongoing compli-
ance with the NSA restrictions, related remediation efforts to address 
concerns raised by the CMAs regarding such access, and the CMAs’ 
requests for information  The ongoing compliance efforts and related 
remediation may adversely affect the Vonage business, including 
changes required to business structure and additional compliance costs  
In addition, violations of a CFIUS mitigation agreement, such as the 
NSA, can result in an enforcement action imposing monetary penalties 
In addition, as previously reported, the Company reached a resolu-
tion (Plea Agreement) in March 2023 with the DOJ regarding the 
non-criminal breaches of its DPA  Under the Plea Agreement, Ericsson 
pleaded guilty to previously deferred charges relating to conduct prior 
to 2017  In addition, Ericsson agreed to pay a fine of USD 206 7 million  
The entry of the Plea Agreement brought the DPA to an end  As set 
forth in the Plea Agreement, Ericsson has certain continuing obliga-
tions through June 2024, including cooperation, reporting evidence or 
allegations of potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations, 
continuing to engage an independent compliance monitor and continu-
ing to improve its compliance program and internal controls 
The Company’s 2019 internal Iraq investigation did not conclude 
that Ericsson made or was responsible for any payments to any terrorist 
organization  With respect to the matters discussed in the 2019 internal 
Iraq investigation report, the Company continues to investigate these 
matters and related matters in full cooperation with the DOJ and the 
SEC  As additional information continues to be identified and evaluated 
during the ongoing investigation in continued cooperation with the 
DOJ and the SEC, it is expected that there will not be any conclusive 
determinations on the outcome of any such investigation until the 
process is completed  The scope and duration of the remaining process 
If Ericsson fails to meet its continuing obligations and is found to 
have breached the Plea Agreement, the Company could face further 
adverse consequences, including additional costs and liability result-
ing from ongoing compliance liabilities with the Plea Agreement and 
extended monitorship, including prosecution for additional federal 
criminal violations, as well as other investigations by governmental

3 4 Ericsson is involved in lawsuits, legal proceedings and regula-
tory investigations, which, if determined unfavorably, could require 
the Company to pay substantial damages, fines and or penalties 
Ericsson is involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its 
business  These proceedings include matters such as commercial 
disputes, intellectual property rights disputes, labor disputes and any 
government or authority inquiry or investigation, e g , antitrust and tax, 
disputes  Legal proceedings can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive 
to normal business operations  Moreover, the results of complex legal 
proceedings are difficult to predict  An unfavorable resolution of a par-
ticular matter could have a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s busi-
ness, operating results, financial condition and reputation  As a publicly 
listed company, Ericsson may be exposed to lawsuits in which plaintiffs 
allege that the Company or its officers have failed to comply with securi-
ties laws, stock market regulations or other laws, regulations or require-
ments  Whether or not there is merit to such claims, the time and costs 
incurred to defend the Company and its officers and the potential settle-
ment or compensation to the plaintiffs could have significant impact on 
In addition, the Company is from time to time and may in the future 
be subject to additional inquiries, litigation or other proceedings or 
actions, regulatory or otherwise, arising in relation to the matters 
described above and related or other litigation and investigative 
matters  An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation or regulatory 
proceeding or action could have a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s 
business, financial condition and operating results 
For additional information regarding certain of the legal proceedings 
and inquiries in which Ericsson is involved, see “Legal proceedings” in 
3 5 Ericsson is subject to a broad range of rapidly evolving privacy, 
security and data localization regulations, as well as corresponding 
contractual obligations, and may be subject to regulatory penalties 
and or breach of contract claims for failure to comply 
Ericsson and certain of its third-party providers receive, store, handle, 
transmit, use and otherwise process proprietary information belonging 
to the Company’s business and information about actual and prospec-
tive customers, end users, employees and service providers, including 
personal information (collectively, “Confidential Information”)  More 
stringent privacy, security and data localization regulations are develop-
ing at a rapid pace in many countries and markets in which Ericsson 
operates, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU/UK), 
and national privacy regimes in India, China and some states of the 
United States (such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and similar 
laws in other states)  These regulations require subject entities to, 
among other things, notify individuals about how personal information 
is used and provide individuals certain rights with respect to such infor-
mation, including rights to access, correct and delete such information 
and to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of such information  In 
addition, cybersecurity regulatory requirements are evolving, including 
regulations and laws related to cybersecurity incident notifications, 
supply chain security, and baseline cybersecurity requirements in the EU, 
US, UK and India, which may be applicable to Ericsson’s internal opera-
Ericsson is also subject to contractual obligations to its customers 
and third parties relating to privacy, security and use of data generally, 
which, amongst other things, requires Ericsson to ensure appropriate 
security and limit the use of customer data, including personal informa-
tion  While Ericsson strives to comply with applicable privacy, security 
and data localization regulations and its contractual obligations, the 
complexity, uncertainty, pace of implementation of new laws, chal-
lenges in applying the concepts to new technologies and contradictions 
in local and regional privacy, security and data localization regulations 
may mean that Ericsson is found to be non-compliant with these 
requirements or its contractual obligations, and subject to penalties and 
breach of contract claims, along with potential damage to Ericsson’s 
brand and reputation  Ericsson continues to periodically review its 
privacy and cybersecurity compliance across its global operations to 
comply with these varied global and ever-changing requirements, which 
does and will continue to require significant investments and resources  
For example, as part of this review cycle, Ericsson is reviewing data 
management in connection with its customer support function and is in 
the process of identifying and implementing certain changes, for exam-
ple, changes to data access and amendments to customer contracts and 
policies and procedures  Due to the diverse nature worldwide of privacy, 
security and data localization regulations, any single incidence of non-
compliance, or serious breach of confidentiality or disruption of secure 
operations, by Ericsson may lead to regulatory agencies in various juris-
dictions levelling separate penalties or judgments against Ericsson  Due 
to the nature of Ericsson’s business, which often involves telecommuni-
cations and critical infrastructure, and the amount of personal informa-
tion of which Ericsson is the controller or processor, such an event could 
have far-ranging consequences, such as orders to change its operations 
or cease processing personal information, even if it was accidental or 
caused by a third party outside of the control of Ericsson  Consequences 
could include large fines, as well as significant damage claims and the 
loss of trust of customers, end users and employees, which may have 
material adverse effects on Ericsson’s business, reputation, financial 
condition and operating results and may require it to change its business 
practices and potentially the services, features, integrations and other 
3 6 Ericsson may be found non-compliant with existing, new and 
emerging human rights and environmental due diligence regulations 
and may be subject to administrative penalties and or civil liability 
The regulatory landscape addressing corporate conduct in relation to 
human rights and environmental impacts is rapidly evolving  New legis-
lation, imposing more stringent due diligence requirements (for example 
the US Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), the Norwegian 
Transparency Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act, France’s Duty of Vigilance 
Law, the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Law), has already 
entered into force and requires Ericsson to assess risks from a full supply 
chain perspective, beyond first-tier suppliers  Additionally, emerging 
legislation from the European Union (the Corporate Sustainability 
Due Diligence Directive and the Forced Labor Ban Regulation) will put 
additional significant requirements on Ericsson to adopt and refine 
additional mechanisms to identify, address, prevent and mitigate certain 
human rights and environmental risks in its operations and business 
relationships and on Ericsson’s Board of Directors to oversee these 
matters  Because of this existing and future regulation, Ericsson may 
be expected to engage in increasingly more detailed due diligence with 
respect to its third parties, such as customers, suppliers and employees, 
some of which may not have the controls and data necessary to assist 
Ericsson with its compliance  Due to the global reach of these legisla-
tions, impacts in any country of operation or where Ericsson engages 
with suppliers, customers or other third parties may lead to non-com-
pliance and thereby potential administrative penalties or civil or other 
liability or reputational harm  Moreover, the UFLPA and the upcoming 
EU Forced Labor Ban Regulation, enable customs authorities to seize 
and destroy shipments that include components produced with forced 
labor, unless the company in question provides credible evidence of full 
supply chain due diligence efforts that prove the absence of forced labor  
Such actions by law enforcement would have significant financial and 
reputational impacts on Ericsson’s operations and business relation-
ships  In order to comply with the relevant legislation, Ericsson needs 
to endeavor to increase supply chain transparency and knowledge of 
supplier base and material content  Ericsson might also need to shift 
its supply chains from high-risk countries, which could have adverse 
financial implications, including increasing the total costs associated 
4 1 Vulnerabilities (and threat actors exploiting vulnerabilities), 
including in Ericsson’s products, services and operations may lead to 
compromise of identities, target of work force, misuse of accounts, 
network disruption, cybersecurity incidents, and material harm to 
Ericsson or Ericsson’s customers, any of which may have a material 
adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, operations, financial perfor-
mance, customer and vendor relationships, reputation and brand, 
and may lead to significant penalties or litigation, or to regulatory 
Ericsson relies on computer systems, hardware, software, technology 
infrastructure and networks for both internal and external operations 
that are critical to its business (collectively, “IT Systems”)  Ericsson 
develops, owns and manages some of these IT Systems but also relies 
on third parties for a range of IT Systems and related products and 
services, including but not limited to cloud computing services  Ericsson 
faces numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks, including from diverse 
threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic 
hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such 
as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), 
malfeasance by insiders, human or technological error, and as a result 
of bugs, misconfigurations or exploited vulnerabilities in software or 
Cyberattacks and security incidents are expected to accelerate in 
both frequency and impact as attacks are increasingly sophisticated and 
utilize tools and techniques that are designed to circumvent controls, 
avoid detection, and remove or obfuscate forensic evidence, which 
means that Ericsson may be unable to detect, investigate, contain or 
recover from future attacks or incidents in a timely or effective manner  
For example, the presence of vulnerabilities in Ericsson’s products, 
services or operations, may not be detected during product develop-
ment and operations, and may be leveraged by a threat actor to cause 
material harm to Ericsson or Ericsson’s customers  Vulnerabilities in 
Ericsson’s products, solutions or services not detected and treated 
during product development or solution delivery may be exploited 
by a threat actor to cause harm to Ericsson’s customers, end users or 
Ericsson  Vulnerabilities could be brought in through different stages 
of the product life cycle  In some situations, it may be hard to detect 
these vulnerabilities due to their location, or due to the fact that they are 
unknown or “zero-day” vulnerabilities  As almost any modern software 
can contain open source and third-party components, so does software 
in networks, and unmitigated security exposures can put Ericsson cus-
tomers at varying levels of risk and expose Ericsson to liabilities or loss of 
Moreover, threat actors exploiting vulnerabilities in Ericsson’s 
IT Systems, processes or personnel due to insufficient implementa-
tion of controls, such as lack of access management or use of more 
sophisticated attack techniques could result in security incidents that 
may impact the confidentiality, availability or integrity of Ericsson’s IT 
Systems, Confidential Information, personnel, products, services, or 
solutions  These incidents may include data breaches, intrusions, espio-
nage, disruptive attacks utilizing malware (such as ransomware or other 
extortion-based tactics), exploitation of hardware or software vulner-
abilities, bugs, hardware or software misconfigurations in Ericsson’s 
IT Systems, data privacy infringements, leakage of Confidential 
Information, unauthorized or accidental usage or modification of 
data or accounts and general malfeasance  For example, in 2023, an 
anonymous individual or group of individuals obtained and exploited 
unlawful access to a system Ericsson uses to interface externally with 
its customers to remove a small number of non-sensitive materials from 
that system  While Ericsson did not experience significant financial loss, 
data theft, encryption or any significant disruptions to normal business 
operations, by reason of the incident, Ericsson further fortified security 
measures in the impacted system in response to the intrusion 
Ericsson utilizes third parties to a large extent to whom the Company 
has outsourced significant aspects of Ericsson’s IT Systems, product 
development, services, finance and other internal and external-facing 
operations  Events or incidents caused as a result of vulnerabilities 
in their operations or products could have a material adverse effect 
on Ericsson, Ericsson’s business, potentially disrupting operations, 
leaking valuable or sensitive information, personal data or damaging 
Ericsson’s products that have been installed in the Company’s custom-
ers’ networks  Furthermore, Ericsson has acquired and continues to 
acquire companies that may have cybersecurity vulnerabilities and or 
unsophisticated security measures, which may expose the Company to 
significant cybersecurity, operational, and financial risks 
A cybersecurity incident in Ericsson’s operations or supply chain could 
have an adverse impact on the integrity of solutions or services provided 
by Ericsson as well as Ericsson’s ability to comply with legal, regulatory 
or contractual requirements  These incidents may include tampering 
with components, the inclusion of backdoors or implants, the uninten-
tional inclusion of vulnerabilities in components or software, and cyber-
security incidents which prevent a supplier from being able to fulfil com-
mitments to Ericsson  In the past few years, widely publicized incidents 
involving third parties such as SolarWinds and Apache’s Log4j software 
are examples of situations in which cyberattacks on supply chain players 
affected companies that utilized their products and services 
Any cybersecurity incident including unintended use, misconfigura-
tion, or unintended actions, involving Ericsson’s operations, supply 
chain, product development, services, third-party providers or installed 
product base, could cause severe harm to Ericsson  For example, a 
misconfiguration incident in 2023 led to a data breach that Ericsson 
reported to certain EU data protection authorities as well as certain 
Ericsson’s IT Systems and storage and other business applications, 
and the systems, storage and other business applications maintained 
by the Company’s third-party providers, have been in the past, and are 
expected to be in the future, subject to cybersecurity incidents  Ericsson 
expects continued attempts to gain unauthorized access to breach 
Ericsson’s IT Systems and or Confidential Information, and other forms 
of malfeasance and disruptive attacks  In some cases, such incidents are 
difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately and the damage caused 
thereby  Ericsson also cannot guarantee that a material incident will not 
If an actual or perceived breach of security occurs in Ericsson’s net-
work or any of its third-party providers’ networks, Ericsson could incur 
significant costs, and the Company’s reputation could be harmed  While 
Ericsson works to safeguard Ericsson’s internal network systems and 
assess and validate the security of the Company’s third-party providers 
to mitigate these potential risks, including through security requirements 
and employee awareness and training, there is no assurance that such 
actions will be sufficient to prevent security incidents  Ericsson cannot 
guarantee that the Company’s cybersecurity program and processes will 
be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting Ericsson’s 
IT Systems and Confidential Information  Any insurance that Ericsson 
carries may be partially or wholly insufficient to cover losses or costs 
associated with responding to and remediating any or all cybersecurity 
In addition, insiders may steal or monitor Confidential Information 
or disrupt networks related to Ericsson or its customers, through techno-
logical or non-technological means  To gain strategic access or to steal 
specific information, competitors or governments may induce insiders or 
recruit employees who sell information or services for personal gain  Any 
insider incident could cause severe harm to Ericsson 
If identities in Ericsson are misused or compromised, it can be difficult 
to differentiate authorized parties undertaking normal account activi-
ties from the threat actor’s use of a compromised identity or credential  
Ericsson’s identity and access management routines are required 
to access Ericsson’s customers’ networks, and any limitation of this 
capability would adversely impact Ericsson’s ability to offer services and 
Furthermore, threat actors may target employees, or other members 
of Ericsson’s workforce, through technological and non-technological 
means  Recent trends have shown that there is a willingness to target 
end users, rather than the entire enterprises  This has manifested itself 
in the rise of threats such as ransomware, phishing, spear phishing, 
spoofing and other extortion methods  With a diverse workforce of 
approximately 100,000 employees, Ericsson is susceptible to risks of 
disruption or information loss resulting from large scale attacks towards 
Ericsson’s employees, or society at large  Additionally, remote and hybrid 
working arrangements at Ericsson (and at many third-party providers) 
also increase this risk due to the challenges associated with managing 
remote computing assets and security vulnerabilities that are present in 
The forgoing risks are increasing and rapidly evolving, and any of the 
above could result in a material adverse effect on Ericsson’s business, 
operations, financial performance, customer and vendor relationships, 
reputation and brand and result in financial penalties, litigation, regula-
tory investigations and other governmental actions 
5 1 Failure to comply with environmental, social and business 
conduct regulations and laws in applicable jurisdictions may expose 
Ericsson to significant penalties and other sanctions or liabilities 
Ericsson is subject to environmental, social and business conduct laws, 
rules and regulations as well as related requirements, which apply to 
Ericsson’s operations, facilities, products and services  Ericsson expects 
these laws, rules and regulations and the burdens associated with com-
plying with them to increase as governments impose new laws, rules, 
regulations and other requirements  Ericsson’s measures for managing 
compliance with these laws, rules, regulations and other requirements 
may not be effective at avoiding potential liabilities arising from 
Ericsson’s current, historical and future processes and operations 
 Ericsson has failed to comply with these laws, rules, regulations and 
other requirements in the past, and if it fails to comply in future, the 
Company could be subject to significant penalties and other sanctions 
or liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on Ericsson  The 
Company’s suppliers’ adherence to Ericsson’s Code of Conduct for 
Business Partners and laws related to environmental, social and busi-
ness conduct is also subject to risk  If suppliers do not adhere to the Code 
of Conduct for Business Partners and laws related to environmental, 
social and business conduct, this could also have a material adverse 
effect on Ericsson  Additionally, there is a risk that Ericsson may have 
to incur expenditures to cover environmental, occupational health and 
safety-liabilities to maintain compliance with current or future appli-
cable laws and regulations or to undertake any necessary remediation  
Future regulations or judgments could have a significant adverse effect 
on Ericsson  These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expec-
tations have resulted in, and are likely to result in, increased general and 
administrative expenses and increased management time and atten-
tion  For example, developing and acting on environmental, social and 
business conduct initiatives, and collecting, measuring, and reporting 
environmental, social and business conduct information and metrics 
can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving 
reporting standards  Failure to manage the foregoing risks could have 
an adverse impact on Ericsson’s business, operating results, financial 
There is also an increased demand from external stakeholders, for 
example non-governmental organizations and investors, on transpar-
ency about environmental, social and business conduct issues that 
might be difficult to fulfil, including expectations that the Company 
make commitments  If Ericsson fails to adequately meet these expecta-
tions or timely meet any related goals or commitments, its business 
and reputation may be adversely affected  In addition, the Company’s 
disclosures regarding such matters may make the Company the target 
of activists, regulators and others who want the Company to take dif-
ferent approaches on such matters or provide additional disclosures 
or commitments, and such engagement could result in increased costs 
or reputational damage  Certain of Ericsson’s disclosures and com-
mitments regarding such matters may be based in part or in whole on 
third-party information or third-party performance, and Ericsson cannot 
assure the quality of third-party information nor assure third-party 
performance  To the extent that Ericsson’s required and voluntary disclo-
sures about sustainability matters increase, Ericsson could be criticized 
for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures  
Climate change and the potential environmental impact resulting 
therefrom may also result in new environmental, health and safety laws, 
rules and regulations that may affect the Company, its suppliers, and 
its customers  Such laws, rules or regulations could cause Ericsson to 
incur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated 
with changes to manufacturing processes, or costs associated with 
the procurement of raw materials and components used in Ericsson’s 
products, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from its customers, 
suppliers or both incurring additional costs that are passed on to us  
These costs may adversely impact the Company, including its reputa-
tion, business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or pros-
pects  In addition, climate change could cause severe weather events, 
such as droughts, heat waves, wildfires, storms, and flooding, to occur 
more frequently or with greater intensity, as well as chronic changes in 
temperatures and rising sea levels, which could pose physical risks to 
the Company’s manufacturing facilities or its suppliers’ facilities, cause 
disruptions in its upstream and downstream logistic flows, and conse-
quently increase operating costs and or cause business interruptions  
It is difficult to reasonably estimate the future impact of environmental 
matters, such as climate change and extreme weather events, including 
5 2 Potential health risks related to radiofrequency electro-mag-
netic fields may subject Ericsson to various product liability claims 
The mobile telecommunications industry is subject to claims that mobile 
devices and other equipment that generate radiofrequency electromag-
netic fields may expose individuals to health risks  At present, a sub-
stantial number of scientific reviews conducted by various independent 
research bodies have concluded that radiofrequency electromagnetic 
fields, when used at levels within the limits prescribed by public health 
authority safety standards and recommendations, cause no adverse 
effects to human health  However, any perceived risk or new scientific 
findings of adverse health effects from mobile communication devices 
and equipment could adversely affect Ericsson through a reduction 
in sales or through liability claims  Although Ericsson’s products are 
designed to comply with currently applicable safety standards and regu-
lations regarding radio frequency electromagnetic fields, the Company 
cannot guarantee that Ericsson will not become the subject of product 
liability claims  Ericsson also cannot guarantee that the Company will 
not be held liable for such claims or be required to comply with future 
changed regulatory requirements  Ericsson may, in addition, be affected 
by regulatory or other restrictions imposed on the Company’s custom-
ers use of radio equipment that may have a material adverse effect on 
Ericsson’s business, operating results, financial condition, reputation 
5 3 Regulations related to “conflict minerals” may cause Ericsson 
to incur additional expenses and may make Ericsson’s supply chain 
In 2012, the SEC adopted a rule requiring disclosures of specified 
minerals (“conflict minerals”) that are necessary to the functionality or 
production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured 
by companies that file periodic reports with the SEC, whether or not 
these products or their components are manufactured by third par-
ties  Ericsson may incur material costs to comply with the disclosure 
requirements and underlying due diligence  These requirements could 
adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of minerals used 
in the manufacture of certain of Ericsson’s products, which may have 
a material adverse effect on its business  In addition, since Ericsson’s 
supply chain is complex, the Company may not be able to sufficiently 
verify the origins for these minerals contained in its products through the 
due diligence procedures that Ericsson implements, which may harm its 
reputation and its business  Ericsson may also encounter challenges if 
customers request that all Ericsson’s product components be certified as 
“conflict-free”  Ericsson acknowledges that similar challenges exist for 
other mineral and metals, outside the scope of the SEC disclosure rule 
In addition, in March 2023, the European Commission announced a 
proposed Critical Raw Materials Act, which would seek to improve the 
EU’s access to a secure and sustainable supply of certain raw materials 
that are to be designated strategic or critical  The European Parliament 
and European Council reached a political agreement on the Critical Raw 
Materials Act in November 2023, and it is anticipated that the Critical 
Raw Materials Act will enter into force in early 2024  The legislative 
initiatives under the Critical Raw Materials Act may impact Ericsson’s 
current supply chains in relation to the sourcing of certain materials, and 
such impact may therefore have an adverse effect on its business

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts of the current period  These matters were 
addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion 
thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, 
but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters 
Ericsson generates revenues primarily from sales of hardware, software, 
and services  to its customers  The majority of these revenues are 
related to large multi-year framework agreements with customers which 
often include discounts and incentives arrangements   The customers 
associated with those issue purchase orders under these framework 
agreements that in combination constitute a contract and commitment 
to purchases of products and services over the duration of the agreement 
with the customer  These large contracts may give rise to a risk of mate-
rial misstatement due to incorrect identification of performance obliga-
tions and timing of revenue recognition for the respective obligation, 
that could have a material impact on the financial statements 
Ericsson conducts an assessment at contract inception to determine 
which promised goods and services in a contract are distinct and 
accordingly identified as performance obligations  The amount and 
timing of revenue recognized is determined in relation to the individual 
performance obligations of the contract  Transaction prices includ-
ing variable considerations, discounts, concessions and incentive agreements, are estimated at the commencement of the contract 
(and periodically thereafter)  Judgment is used in the estimation process 
based on historical experience with the type of business and customer 
and in allocating revenue to each performance obligation by reference 
We identified revenue recognition from large contracts with custom-
ers as a key audit matter due to the complex application of revenue 
recognition accounting standards and that it requires management to 
make judgments and estimates in determining the amount and timing 
of revenue recognized in relation to individual elements of the contracts  
Our audit procedures related to the amount and timing of revenue 
recognized in relation to significant contracts included, but were not 
limited to the following: – We tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls over revenue 
recognition with particular focus on the controls related to the 
identification of performance obligations within large contracts with 
customers and determination of the timing of recognition for each 
revenue obligation  – We tested a sample of large contracts with customers to assess man-
agement’s judgments and estimates related to the identification of 
performance obligations and determination of the timing of recogni-
tion for each revenue obligation based on the contract  – We tested a sample of revenue transactions recorded during the year 
by tracing them to supporting evidence of delivery and acceptance 
and assessed the judgments and estimates for revenue recorded in 
the period by comparing it to contract terms such as, delivery terms, 
transaction prices including variable considerations, discounts and 
incentive agreements  – We tested a sample of ongoing negotiations with existing customers 
and analysed reversals of revenue subsequent to year end for indica-
tors of unrecorded discounts and concessions during the period

Valuation of Goodwill related to Vonage, Cradlepoint, and Cloud 
Goodwill is a significant asset in the consolidated balance sheet and 
the Company’s evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill involves the 
comparison of the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit 
to their carrying values  The Company’s assessment of the recoverable 
amount is based on discounted future cash flow models derived from 
internal business plans covering five years followed by a terminal value 
or with a declining growth period before terminal value  The assessment 
requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
regarding forecasts of future sales growth, operating income, working 
capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as assumptions 
on discount rates  In Q3 2023 Ericsson recorded an impairment charge 
of SEK 31 9 billion attributed to the cash generating unit Vonage mainly 
due to macroeconomic headwinds, including rising interest rates and 
We identified valuation of the Vonage, Cradlepoint, and Cloud 
Software and Services goodwill as a key audit matter due to the 
significant judgments and estimates used in determining the forecasts 
of future sales growth, operating income, working capital and capital 
expenditure requirements, as well as assumptions on discount and 
terminal growth rates  Changes in these assumptions could have a 
significant impact on either the recoverable amount, the amount of any 
impairment charge, or both  The assessment of management’s assump-
tions regarding recoverable amount requires a high degree of auditor 
judgment, including an increased extent of complexity and the need to 
Our audit procedures related to the assumptions regarding recover-
able amount included, but were not limited to the following: – We tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls over good-
will impairment evaluation and determination of the recoverable 
amount with particular focus on the controls over management’s 
preparation and review of assumptions for future sales growth, 
operating income, working capital, capital expenditure requirements 
and method for determining the discount rate used  – We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future 
sales growth, operating income working capital and capital expendi-
ture requirements by comparing actual results to management’s 
historical forecasts, the Company’s historical results, external analyst 
reports and internal communications to management and the Board 
of Directors  – With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the 
discount rates, including testing the underlying source information 
and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations, and developing 
a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the dis-
count rates selected by management  – With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we further evaluated 
the company’s sensitivity analysis by comparing to our own sensitiv-
ity analysis to corroborate the disclosures around assumptions that 
are most sensitive to a reasonably possible change that could cause 
the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount for a cash

not cover this other information and we do not express any form of 
assurance conclusion regarding this other information 
In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified 
above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent 
with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  In this procedure 
we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the 
audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for 
the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual 
Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accord-
ance with IFRS as adopted by the EU   The Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they 
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, 
In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the 
assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern  They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  The going 
concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, 
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so  The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of 
Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things 
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from 
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an 
auditor’s report that includes our opinions  Reasonable assurance is a 
high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted 
in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards 
in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists  
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material 
if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected 
to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these 
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit  
We also: – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to fraud or error, 
design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and 
obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide 
a basis for our opinions  The risk of not detecting a material mis-
statement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from 
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, 
misrepresentations, or the override of internal control 
– Obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control relevant 
to our audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate 
in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opin-
ion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control  – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures 
made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director  – Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ and the 
Managing Director’s use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  We 
also draw a conclusion, based on the audit evidence obtained, 
as to whether any material uncertainty exists related to events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the company’s and the 
group’s ability to continue as a going concern  If we conclude that 
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in 
our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts or, if such disclosures are inadequate, 
to modify our opinion about the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained 
up to the date of our auditor’s report  However, future events or 
conditions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue 
as a going concern  – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the disclo-
sures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that 
achieves fair presentation  – Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within the 
group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts  We are 
responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the 
group audit  We remain solely responsible for our opinions 
We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, the 
planned scope and timing of the audit  We must also inform of signifi-
cant audit findings during our audit, including any significant deficien-
We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that 
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding inde-
pendence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, 
and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards 
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we 
determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the most 
important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are therefore 
the key audit matters  We describe these matters in the auditor’s report 
unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about the matter 
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson 
(publ) for the financial year January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023 and 
the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss 
We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that 
the profit to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the 
statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the 
We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section  We are inde-
pendent of the parent company and the group in accordance with pro-
fessional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled 
our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropria-
tions of the company’s profit or loss  At the proposal of a dividend, this 
includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable consider-
ing the requirements which the company’s and the group’s type of 
operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company’s and 
the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organization 
and the administration of the company’s affairs  This includes among 
other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the group’s 
financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organization 
is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the 
company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring 
manner  The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administra-
tion according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instructions 
and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the 
company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle the manage-
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby 
our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to 
assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of 
the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect: – has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can 
give rise to liability to the company, or – in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, 
the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association 
Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of 
the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to 
assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guar-
antee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions 
that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appro-
priations of the company’s profit or loss are not in accordance with the 
As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and maintain 
professional scepticism throughout the audit  The examination of the 
administration and the proposed appropriations of the company’s 
profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts  Additional 
audit procedures performed are based on our professional judgment 
with starting point in risk and materiality  This means that we focus the 
examination on such actions, areas and relationships that are material 
for the operations and where deviations and violations would have 
particular importance for the company’s situation  We examine and test 
decisions undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge 
from liability  As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we examined 
the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection of support-
ing evidence in order to be able to assess whether the proposal is in 
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also examined that  the Board of Directors and the 
Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and consoli-

Responsibilities of The Board of Directors and the Managing Director The Bord of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for 
the preparation of the Esef report in accordance with the Chapter 16, 
Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), and for 
such internal control that  the Board of Directors and the Managing 
Director determine is necessary to prepare the Esef report without material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error 
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the Esef 
report is in all material respects prepared in a format that meets the 
requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities 
Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures performed 
RevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve 
reasonable assurance that the Esef report is prepared in a format that 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a 
guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 and 
generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists  Misstatements can arise from 
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, 
they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions

The examination involves obtaining evidence, through various pro-
cedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format that enables 
uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement in the 
report, whether due to fraud or error  In carrying out this risk assess-
ment, and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in 
the circumstances, the auditor considers those elements of internal 
control that are relevant to the preparation of the Esef report by the 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  
The examination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and 
reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors and the 
The procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report has 
been prepared in a valid XHMTL format and a reconciliation of the Esef 
report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated accounts

making or having responsibility for making payments to a terrorist 
organization or other improper payments, which could lead to mate-
rial additional liability – Risks related to our ongoing compliance with obligations under

In this section, the Company presents its Alternative Performance 
Measures (APMs), which are not recognized measures of financial 
performance under IFRS  This section includes a reconciliation of the 
APM’s to the most directly reconcilable line items in the financial state-
ments  The presentation of APMs has limitations as analytical tools 
and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for related 
financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS 
APMs are presented to enhance an investor’s evaluation of ongoing 
operating results, to aid in forecasting future periods and to facilitate 
Management uses these APMs to, among other things, evaluate 
ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning 
and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of certain performance-
based compensation  APM’s should not be viewed as substitutes for 
income statement or cash flow items computed in accordance with IFRS 
The Company decided to include EBIT and EBIT margin excluding 
restructuring charges and goodwill impairment to better explain the 
financial performance  Free cash flow before M&A as percentage of net 
sales (%) is added since it is used by the Company as one of the long-
term targets  Adjusted earnings per share is removed as an APM since it

Additionally, Ericsson provides forward-looking targets for EBITA margin excluding restructuring charges and free cash flow before M&A, which are non-IFRS financial measures  Ericsson 
has not provided quantitative reconciliation of these targets to the most directly comparable IFRS measures because certain information needed to reconcile these non-IFRS financial 
measures to the most comparable IFRS financial measures are dependent on specific items or impacts that are not yet determined, are subject to incarcerating and variability in timing

Ericsson needs to combine technology and innovation 
with operational excellence, the best talent and a strong

Introduction from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee
and paid in accordance with the Guidelines  In the annual review of total remuneration, 
This Remuneration report provides a summary of how the Guidelines 
for Remuneration to Group Management (the “Guidelines”) of Telefon-
aktiebolaget LM Ericsson (“Ericsson” or the “Company”), adopted by the 
Annual General Meeting 2020 (applicable until March 28, 2023) and by the 
Annual General Meeting 2023 (applicable from March 29, 2023), have been 
complied with during the financial year 2023  The report also contains infor-
mation on the total remuneration, including fixed and variable remuneration, 
of Ericsson’s President and CEO and Executive Vice President  In addition, 
the report contains a summary of the Company’s current short-term and 
long-term variable remuneration programs for the Executive Team 
During 2023, the Board of Directors proposed amended Guidelines, 
which were approved by the Annual General Meeting 2023  The 2023 
Guidelines are intended to remain in place for four years until the Annual 
The remuneration of the President and CEO and the Executive Vice 
resident disclosed in the report represents their total remuneration, 
regardless of whether it is paid through the Company or by another group 
The Guidelines, adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2023, can be 
found on pages 27–29 of the Financial report  The Auditors’ report on the 
Company’s compliance with the Guidelines is available on Ericsson’s web-
This report does not include remuneration to the Board of Directors  
Board remuneration is approved annually by the Annual General Meeting 
and is disclosed in Note G2 on pages 73–74 of the Financial report for 2023 
Information on Ericsson’s performance during the financial year is included 
As part of Ericsson’s business strategy implementation and safeguarding 
the sustainable long-term interests of the Company, Ericsson must attract, 
retain, and motivate employees with the right skills and offer them competitive 
remuneration  Long-term shareholder value creation and performance-based 
remuneration are the basis for remuneration at Ericsson  The Guidelines aim 
to ensure that remuneration is consistent with Ericsson’s current remuneration 
philosophy and practices for the Company’s employees based on the princi-
ples of competitiveness, fairness, transparency, and performance  The main 
objectives of the Guidelines are to: – attract and retain highly competent, performing, and motivated people 
who have the ability, experience, and skill to deliver on the Ericsson 
strategy; – encourage behavior consistent with Ericsson’s culture and core values; – ensure fairness in reward by delivering total remuneration that is appro-
priate but not excessive, and clearly explained; – have a total compensation mix of fixed pay, variable pay and benefits 
that is competitive where Ericsson competes for talent; and – encourage variable remuneration which aligns employees with clear 
and relevant targets, reinforces their performance and enables flexible 
The Guidelines also aim to enable the Company to offer attractive and glob-
ally competitive total remuneration to the Executive Team 
According to the Guidelines, the remuneration to the Executive Team 
must be in line with market conditions and should consist of the following 
components: fixed salary, variable remuneration, pension and other bene-
fits  In addition to remuneration covered by the Guidelines, the shareholders 
have decided to implement long-term variable remuneration (“LTV”) pro-
grams  The LTV 2021, LTV 2022 and LTV 2023 programs are still ongoing 
In 2023, there has been one deviation from the Guidelines (see section 
“Deviations from adopted Guidelines for remuneration to Group Manage-
ment”)  There has been no clawback of remuneration in 2023 
In 2023, the following key decisions were made by the Remuneration 
Committee and the Board of Directors regarding remuneration: – The achievement for LTV 2021 was set at 100% of target, based on 
pre-determined performance conditions: group operating income and 
relative and absolute total shareholder return (TSR)  – The level of achievement of the performance condition for the Group’s 
operating income for LTV 2023 was set at 0%  – To include STV in the remuneration package for the President and CEO 
from January 1, 2024 in alignment with the Remuneration Guidelines 
and in direct response to investor feedback  Börje Ekholm was appointed 
as CEO of Ericsson on January 16, 2017, and since then, his compensa-
tion structure has been base salary, pension allowance and long-term 
variable compensation  The current business strategy is focused on a 
combination of short-, mid- and long-term achievements on leadership 
in mobile networks, focused expansion into enterprise and to establish 
lasting cultural transformation  The external market typically offers CEOs 
a combination of long-term and short-term variable pay  From January 
1, 2024, the variable compensation for the President and CEO, will be 
50% target opportunity for short-term variable pay and 150% target 
opportunity for long-term variable pay i e , total 200% of annual base 
pay  This is an increase in the total variable pay at target opportunity 
from 190% to 200% of annual base salary compared with 2023  – To further drive accountability throughout the organization, all employees 
who are eligible for an STV pay-out may be denied all or part the entitle-
ment if they act in breach of Ericsson’s Code of Business Ethics (CoBE)  
In addition, top executives are subject to evaluation according to a set of 
pre-defined integrity criteria, which relate to compliance training, third 
party management, allegation management and other items tied to the 
Company’s Ethics and Compliance Program (E&C)  Underperformance 
against these pre-defined criteria can reduce STV pay-out by up to 100%, 
while exceptional performance may justify an additional incentive of up to 
a maximum of 10% of the executive’s annual base salary 
The Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors continuously 
evaluate the effectiveness of the LTV programs in achieving the objective 
of supporting the Company’s strategic goals and sustainable long-term 
interests  In addition, the LTV programs potential to increase the long-term 
focus of the Executive Team and to link their interests with the long-term 
expectations and interests of shareholders is evaluated  – After evaluating the ongoing LTV programs for the Executive Team, the 
Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that 
the ongoing LTV programs for 2021 and 2022, as well as the completed 
programs for 2018, 2019 and 2020, enabled the Company to attract, 
retain and motivate Executives and offer them globally competitive 
remuneration  Although the performance condition for the Group’s 
operating income (EBITA) has a one-year performance period, it has 
a three-year vesting period which is the same as the vesting period 
of the performance conditions relating to absolute and relative Total 
Shareholder Return (TSR), which is in line with the objectives of the LTV 
programs  This means that participants cannot redeem any of the Per-
formance Share rights granted before the end of the three-year vesting 
period and that participants are fully exposed to share price movements 
during the three-year period  – LTV programs for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 have supported the 
long-term targets, and the Remuneration Committee and the Board of 
Directors proposed at the Annual General Meeting 2023 to approve an 
LTV program to the Executive Team with the same structure as previ-
ous LTV programs with targets to further strengthen Ericsson’s and the 
Executive Team’s commitment to long-term sustainability and responsi-
ble business practices  – Also, for 2024 the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors 
propose to include other Executives in LTV 2024 in order to be covered 
by a plan that delivers in shares  This is to further reinforce the alignment 
In addition to complying with its formal legal and regulatory obligations with 
respect to trading restrictions, from time to time the Company may elect to 
temporarily restrict trading in Ericsson shares by board members, the Execu-

To support the execution of Ericsson’s business strategy and the achievement of the Group’s financial targets, the Company’s variable remunera-
tion program focuses on targets related to financial profitability, the Group’s operating income (EBITA) and TSR  The variable remuneration is thus 
designed to create incentives to contribute to Ericsson’s short- and long-term strategic plan and business objectives 
Implementation of ﬁxed remuneration and pension for the President and CEO and the Executive Vice President
The table below shows the implementation of fixed remuneration and pension for the President and CEO and the Executive Vice President 
During the annual review of the total remuneration, the Board of 
Directors decided on a salary increase of 3% of the ﬁxed salary 
as of January 1, 2023 for the President and CEO  The increase 
reﬂects the performance of the President and CEO until the end 
The ﬁxed salary level for 2023 is considered appropriate in 
relation to the responsibility of being the President and CEO 
of a leading global provider of ICT solutions, compared to the 
remuneration packages for the position of President and CEO 
The salary level reﬂects Fredrik Jejdling’s responsibility as head 
of Ericsson’s largest business area, Networks  The salary level 
is considered competitive in the external market for both other 
VPs on leading ICT solution providers and for the position of 
base salary parts exceeding the cap in ITP1 (30 income base amounts)

Ericsson believes that, where possible, variable remuneration should 
be encouraged as an integral part of total remuneration  The aim is to 
link performance and pay by reconciling the employees’ interests with 
Ericsson’s strategic business objectives, sustainable long-term and 
All variable remuneration programs have defined maximum grant 
The short-term variable remuneration depends on a combination 
of performance of the company at Group level and the relevant unit of 
the employee while the long-term variable remuneration depends on 
Annual short-term variable remuneration is paid through cash-based 
programs that depend only on financial performance targets  The con-
crete business objectives are calculated on the basis of the annual busi-
ness plan approved by the Board of Directors, which in turn is based on 
the Company’s long-term strategy  Ericsson strives for industry-leading 
operating margins and return on investment as well as good cash gen-
eration, and therefore the starting point is to have a financial profitability 
target, which is a measure of operating profitability net of capital costs 
The financial profitability targets are defined for the Executive Team: – At group level for heads of group functions – As a combination of group level and business area level for business 
area managers – As a combination of group level and market area level for market 
To further drive accountability throughout the organization, all employ-
ees who are eligible for an STV pay-out may be denied all or part the 
entitlement if they act in breach of Ericsson’s CoBE  In addition, top 
executives are subject to evaluation according to a set of pre-defined 
integrity criteria, which relate to compliance training, third party man-
agement, allegation management and other items tied to the Compa-
ny’s E&C program  Underperformance against these pre-defined criteria 
can reduce STV pay-out by up to 100%, while exceptional performance 
may justify an additional incentive of up to a maximum of 10% of the 
The President and CEO’s compensation in 2023 did not include an STV 
component  The Remuneration Committee decides on and approves all 
objectives set for the other members of the Executive Team  These objec-
tives are broken down into unit-related objectives across the Group, where 
applicable  The Remuneration Committee monitors the appropriateness 
and fairness of the target levels for the Group, Business Areas and Market 
Areas throughout the performance year and has the power to revise them 
if they are no longer relevant, or if they no longer contribute to shareholder 
value  The 2023 weighting for the Executive Vice President is made up of 
40% Economic Profit for the Group and 60% Economic Profit for business 
The tables below describe the STV 2023 outcome for the Executive Vice President, which is determined by evaluating performance against the 
Executive Vice President and Head of Business Area Networks – Fredrik Jejdling (STV 2023)
1) Economic proﬁt means operating income minus cost of capital 
The current LTV programs have been designed to encourage long-
term commitment and value creation in line with Ericsson’s long-term 
strategic goals and shareholders’ interests  They form part of an overall 
remuneration package and normally extend over at least three years  
As these are variable remuneration programs, it is not possible to predict 
the outcome when they are launched, and the remuneration depends 
on long-term personal commitment, the Company’s performance, 
the share price performance and the Company’s performance against relevant ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics 
The LTV programs launched at Ericsson consist of share-based 
remuneration for members of the Executive Team and Executives  
The objective of the LTV programs is to attract, retain and motivate 
executives in a competitive market through performance-based and 
share-based incentives, and to encourage the building of a significant 
shareholding, in order to create a common ownership interest between 
the Executive Team and shareholders  Awards under LTV 2018, 2019, 
2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 (Performance Share Rights) are made free 
of charge and entitle participants, subject to the achievement of certain 
performance targets, to receive a number of shares free of charge after 
the expiry of a three-year vesting period for each program  Awards 
of shares under the Performance Share Rights are made upon the 
achievement of challenging performance conditions, which are defined 
for each year’s program at the time of its launch  The portion of the LTV 
Performance Share Rights that will potentially vest will be determined 
at the end of the relevant performance period based on whether the 
predefined criteria for this year’s LTV program have been met, with the 
performance period being one to three years  It is a general requirement 
that the participants remain employed for three years from the date of 
grant of the Performance Share Rights in order to be eligible to receive 
the outcome  Provided that the performance conditions have been met 
during the performance period and the participant has continued to 
be employed (except in exceptional circumstances) during the vesting 
period, shares will be awarded as soon as possible after the vesting 
period has expired  When deciding on the final exercise level of the 
Performance Share Rights, the Board of Directors considers whether 
the exercise level is reasonable in light of the Company’s financial 
performance and position, stock market conditions and other circum-
stances  Otherwise, the Board of Directors reserves the right to reduce 
the level of outputs to a lower level deemed appropriate 
The Board may, at any time up to the last day of the vesting period, 
reduce (including cancel) the number of shares to which the Performance 
Share Rights are entitled, to the extent deemed appropriate in view of: – the Company’s financial performance and position; – stock market conditions; and or – such other circumstances and reasons as the Board of Directors 
In addition, to drive accountability throughout the organization and 
support the integration of Ethics and Compliance into all aspects of its 
business, the Company has the right to unilaterally decide to withhold 
all or part of such awards for a participant in respect of years in which 
the participant has violated Ericsson’s Code of Business Ethics  The 
Company also has the right to unilaterally decide to demand repayment, 
in whole or in part, of awards relating to years in which a participant has

2)  The Board of Directors decided that the target achievement level for the performance conditions development of absolute TSR and relative TSR amounted to 0% and 0% respectively, based on the achievements 
of -16,17% absolute TSR and ranking 12 (lower than all companies in the peer group) for relative TSR, resulting in an overall achieved target achievement level of 100% for LTV 2021  Performance shares vest at the

Information on guidelines for shareholdings by Executive Team 
The Board has adopted the following shareholding guidelines to apply 
to current and future members of the Executive Team as of January 1, 
2019, to encourage management to build and maintain a shareholding 
to create a common ownership interest between the Company’s share-
holders and the members of the Executive Team: – The President and CEO must build-up and maintain a shareholding 
equivalent to at least 200% of the annual fixed salary  – Other members of the Executive Team must build up and maintain 
a shareholding equivalent to at least 75% of their respective annual 
The current members of the Executive Team shall have the opportunity 
to build up the required shareholding over a period of five years starting 
from January 1, 2019  In the event that new members of the Executive 
Team are appointed, they are expected to meet the shareholding 
requirement on the anniversary date five years after they are granted 
their first Performance Shares under the LTV Plans  For current mem-
bers of Executive Team, the requirement date is extended for one year 
as a part of the self-imposed trading recommendations for ET members 
and due to the company’s decision to apply net delivery of shares for 
all LTV plans during the years 2017–2020  The Board of Directors 
considers the following for the purpose of meeting the shareholding 
requirement: – Holdings of Ericsson Class B-shares held or acquired by the Executive Team member – Vested but unexercised options (value calculated after tax and after 
utilization costs) – Share rights held by the member of the Executive Team, for which 
performance and or employment conditions have been met, but 
which must be held for a certain period of time (value calculated 
Shares, synthetic shares, or options that are subject to performance conditions and continued employment, but which have not vested, 
should not be counted under the shareholding guidelines 
The Remuneration Committee shall monitor compliance with the 
shareholding guidelines and regularly report to the Board of Directors 
and inform the members of the Executive Team on the extent to which 
the shareholding guidelines have been complied with 
The holdings of each of the members of the Executive Team are 
disclosed on pages 20–24 of the Corporate Governance report 
Deviations from adopted Guidelines for remuneration to 
The Guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020 and as 
applicable until March 28, 2023, prescribed a minimum weighting of 
short-term variable compensation (“STV”) targets of 40% to be defined 
at Group level  At the Annual General Meeting 2023, The Guidelines 
where amended and expected to be applicable through the Annual 
One of the purposes of the Guidelines adopted by the Annual General 
Meeting 2023 was to clarify the mandate for the Board of Directors and 
Remuneration Committee to define meaningful STV targets linked to 
Ericsson’s business plan  This enables STV targets to be defined and 
weighted differently for different parts of the business given the phase 
in the business lifecycle they are in as required by the business strategy  
Therefore, detailed requirements for mandatory weighting and defini-
In line with the purpose of the new Guidelines and upon recommenda-
tion from the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors resolved 
on February 8, 2023, on a 20% weighting STV targets for 2023 on 
Group level for the Executive Team member George Mulhern  This was a deviation from the then applicable Guidelines during the period from 
January 1, 2023, to March 28, 2023  The rationale behind the decision 
to deviate from the then applicable Guidelines was to provide greater 
priority to unit targets, and to drive growth in revenue and profits, as 
appropriate for the current business lifecycle of Cradlepoint  There has 
been no deviation from the decision-making procedures as described in

Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023
Ericsson has identified material impacts related to climate change both 
upstream and downstream in its value chain, as well as in its own operations  
The ICT sector represents a relatively small share1) of GHG emissions, with 
emissions primarily being derived from the sector’s energy consumption  The 
vast majority of GHG emissions in Ericsson’s value chain2), approximately 90% 
in recent years, occur downstream, primarily from electricity consumption in the 
use phase of sold products  Upstream emissions, which include both resource 
extraction and processing, manufacturing activities and transportation rep-
resent around 10% of total value chain emissions but this share is expected to 
increase as more renewable energy is deployed and used in the downstream 
portion of the value chain, reducing emissions from the use phase of sold 
products  While emissions from Ericsson’s direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) 
represent less than 1% of the total carbon footprint, they are still considered 
material since all sectors of the economy need to reduce emissions in order to 
In the past, with the rollout of each new generation of mobile network stand-
ards (such as 2G, 3G and 4G), new equipment has been added, which over 
time has increased total energy consumption across global mobile networks  
The increases have been stable across each mobile generation  Ericsson’s 
own research3) shows that it is the surface coverage and the installation of 
new equipment when deploying new generations of mobile networks that has 
driven increased energy usage, rather than increased data traffic  
While the ICT sector must address its own carbon footprint, it can also play 
an important role in enabling other sectors in their decarbonization efforts  
Many of the solutions needed in other sectors to reduce emissions, such as 
management systems and smart meters in buildings, smart electrical grids, 
telematics, and storage and inventory management solutions in enterprises, are 
all dependent on ICT solutions and infrastructure to function  Ericsson’s own 
peer-reviewed 2015 research4) suggests that ICT solutions have the potential 
to enable decarbonization of up to 15% in other sectors by 2030, and poten-
tially even higher when including the enabling potential of 5G and the Internet 
As part of its overall climate strategy and its commitment to align to the 
reporting recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD), Ericsson has analyzed potential climate-related risks 
and opportunities using two different scenarios: Net Zero 2050 and Current 
Policies  The main conclusions from this analysis are presented below  A 
summary of the assessment methodology and assumptions under the two 
scenarios used is included at the end of this note  The results of the scenario 
analysis were incorporated into Ericsson’s materiality analysis when identify-
ing material climate-related risks and opportunities  
Under the Net Zero 2050 scenario, both emission reduction targets and higher 
energy prices drive further efforts by communications service providers to 
increase energy performance in mobile networks  The combination of these 
two factors creates opportunities for Ericsson to expand its offering of network 
Enabling emission reductions in enterprise sectors 
As other more emission-intense sectors – such as power and utilities, transport 
and manufacturing – rapidly increase efforts to decarbonize in the Net Zero 
2050 scenario, significant investments are made to achieve decarbonization 
goals  These investments, such as the deployment of smart grids and private 
networks, all depend on ICT solutions, which provides significant opportunity 
for Ericsson to expand its connectivity offering to these sectors 
Increased demand for equipment with lower embodied emissions
In the Net Zero 2050 scenario, the price of carbon emissions increases 
substantially  Simultaneously, Ericsson’s customers rapidly increase the 
share of renewable energy used to power the networks, meaning the relative 
share of their upstream emissions increases  To address these embodied, and 
increasingly costly, emissions, customers’ demand for low-carbon products, 
meaning equipment made from less carbon-intense materials and processes, is 
expected to increase, which can mean new business opportunities for Ericsson  
In the Net Zero 2050 scenario, the price of carbon emissions increases sub-
stantially, leading to increased costs for actors in Ericsson’s value chain  While 
direct impacts are limited, indirect impact upstream in the value chain is more 
significant, assuming emissions stay the same and costs are passed through to 
In the Current Policies scenario, the frequency and intensity of severe weather 
events, as well as coastal and riverine flooding, increases  This leads to height-
ened risks for long-term business interruptions as well as damage to inventory 
and fixed assets in the supply chain at both outsourced manufacturing sites 
and at Ericsson’s own sites, such as production facilities and IT centers 
Ericsson’s Sustainability Policy sets out the Company’s foundational principles 
on environmental sustainability, including climate change mitigation  Ericsson 
uses life-cycle analysis (LCA) methodology to determine its significant envi-
ronmental aspects and to assess the environmental impact of ICT, reduce the 
negative environmental impact of its own operations and take a precautionary 
approach to environmental challenges, applying design to ensure continuous 
environmental improvements with a life-cycle perspective on its portfolio  
Ericsson also advocates the use of ICT to mitigate and adapt to climate change 
Ericsson’s Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners requires the com-
pany and its business partners, including suppliers, to develop and implement 
plans and targets to reduce their GHG emissions  Business partners must 
adopt, and publicly disclose, their targets for reducing emissions in alignment 
with the science-based 1 5 °C ambition and actively work toward achieving 
them, which includes public reporting on progress made on an annual basis  
The CoC is based on the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct and 
the UN Global Compact 10 principles, but also includes Ericsson-specific 
requirements and is part of standard-supplier contracts  It is available in multiple languages on the Company’s website 
For suppliers of hardware components or products, construction work, supply 
services, field maintenance and network rollout operations, as well as those 
with high environmental risks, where their operations significantly impact the 
environment, Ericsson has additional environmental requirements  If energy 
consumption and or GHG emissions are identified as significant environmental 
aspects, the supplier must calculate its carbon footprint, using the GHG proto-
col for its Scope 1, Scope 2 and, if applicable, for its Scope 3 emissions 
Group climate strategy and targets are coordinated and driven by the central 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility unit  On an operational level, 
climate action strategies and policies are integrated across business and mar-
ket areas, as well as Group functions, with each organization being responsible 
for executing on its respective strategies and targets

Ericsson has a SBTi validated target to achieve Net Zero1) value chain emis-
sions by 2040, with a near-term target to reduce total value chain emissions 
by 50% from a 2020 baseline by 2030  The most significant actions that the 
Company plans to take to reach this target are described below 
 Reported value chain emissions (covering Scope, 1, 2 and 3) 2030 target

Total value chain emissions as shown in the graph above should be considered illustrative of Ericsson’s Net 
Zero transition plan, as they include forward-looking estimates of future emissions  
Ericsson is working to replace its fleet of internal combustion engine service 
vehicles with a low-emission fleet  The transformation will take place gradually, 
with some countries and market areas expected to transition faster than others 
due to differences in availability of low- or zero-tailpipe emissions vehicles and 
market conditions  In addition, the Company plans to increase the coverage 
and use of fleet management systems and telematics to optimize fleet utiliza-
tion and reduce unnecessary trips, where feasible  Backup generators and 
local heating using fossil fuels at facilities will be phased out or replaced with 
low-emitting alternatives wherever possible  Technical building requirements 
specify limits on the maximum global warming potential for refrigerants used 
Ericsson aims to source 100% renewable energy at its facilities by 2030  In 
addition, Ericsson works together with facility management companies to 
improve the energy efficiency of its facilities  The majority of facilities Ericsson 
Ericsson engages with its high-emitting and strategic first-tier suppliers to have 
them set their own 1 5 °C aligned emission reduction targets  For targets to be 
accepted by Ericsson, they need to include a commitment to halving emissions 
in relevant scopes by 2030, and the supplier must make them public as well as 
commit to report on progress toward the targets publicly and at least annually  
Ericsson continues to engage with those suppliers who have not yet set quali-
1) Implying emission reductions of at least 90% within the set timeframe in the selected scopes 
2) See note O2 on page 41 for an explanation on limitations regarding value chain reporting and disclosures 
To reduce the emissions embodied in hardware products, Ericsson applies 
other measures such as product design and material choice, substitution and 
To prevent emissions from business travel from returning to their pre- 
pandemic levels, Ericsson has set a cap on business travel emissions at 50% 
of their 2019 levels, with each business and market area, Group function and 
subunits being allocated yearly emission budgets for business travel  
Ericsson’s approach for reducing indirect downstream emissions from the 
use of products and services is through improved energy performance of the 
Company’s solutions, which includes hardware, software and service solutions  
A focal point is to ensure that the rollout of 5G does not result in an increase in 
the energy consumption of customers’ mobile networks, as has been the case 
with rollouts of previous generations of mobile communication networks  This 
involves: – Investments in R&D to increase the energy performance of the portfolio  – Planning networks both from a performance and an energy usage 
perspective  – Providing guidance on when and how to modernize equipment and operat-
ing networks intelligently by using artificial intelligence, machine learning 
and other features to reduce energy use during times of low network load 
To further reduce these emissions, customers also need to transition to low-
carbon and renewable energy sources  Reducing energy demand, and subse-
quent consumption, are important steps in making the transition to renewable 
energy sources easier and more financially viable  
Besides improved energy efficiency, Ericsson can support customers with 
the integration of on-site renewable energy generation such as solar and wind 
energy at base station sites  By using the same management system to control 
the radio-access network and the renewable energy sources, the energy supply 
and demand can be optimized for the site conditions  More details on how 
Ericsson is aiming to reduce energy consumption of mobile networks are avail-
able in the Breaking the Energy Curve report on the Company’s website 
For emissions related to product transport, Ericsson is utilizing increased 
data visibility to optimize transport planning and thereby reduce emissions 
Ericsson plans to use carbon removal technologies, such as carbon capture and 
storage, to neutralize the unavoidable part of value chain emissions to reach 
its 2040 Net Zero targets  When such technologies are employed, they will not 
represent more than 10% of the base year carbon footprint and must adhere to 
high standards to ensure the effectiveness and trustworthiness of any Net Zero 
Ericsson has an internal shadow carbon price of USD 100 per metric ton of 
carbon dioxide equivalent applicable to equipment transportation  The shadow 
price is included in the landed cost model when calculating the total price of 
outgoing deliveries of certain hardware product categories  The aim is to visu-
alize the cost of carbon related to downstream transportation when calculating 
and deciding on transport routes for outgoing shipments sourced by Ericsson  
The majority of the product portfolio, made up of communication network 
hardware such as radios and antennas, is currently not covered by any third-
party managed certification scheme for energy efficiency  Products eligible for 
certification, such as servers, constitute a smaller part of the product portfolio  
These are currently not certified according to any such scheme

Reduce energy consumption at radio base station sites by 40%
This target supports the Net Zero target by addressing downstream GHG emissions through reducing the energy consumption of customers’ mobile networks  The target entails reducing the energy consumption of 
radio base station type sites by 40% by 2025 compared with a 2021 baseline  The energy consumption is measured in kWh and target performance is expressed as the average of potential reductions for modeled 
type sites in rural, suburban and urban locations for a service provider operating in Europe  The target is intended to track the Company’s capability to provide energy-efﬁcient solutions to its customers  For this reason, 
it measures energy consumption reduction, compared with the base year, from the best performing solution of software and hardware available in the target and reporting year, respectively  These values should be

emissions of 108,000 metric tons of CO2e  Share of GHG emissions by scope
Suppliers with 1 5 °C aligned emissions reduction targets
Emissions are reported according to the GHG Protocol using financial control 
as the basis for consolidation  Emissions are reported in CO2e and include the 
following gases and chemicals: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous 
oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorochemicals (PFCs)  
Measurement periods are aligned to the fiscal year and based on the latest 
available data at cut-off date, supplemented with extrapolated estimates for 
Consumed volumes of fuels and refrigerants are multiplied by applicable 
emission factors to derive emissions  Fuel consumption in the service vehicle 
fleet is estimated partially based on vehicle telematics data and partially on 
contracted yearly mileages for leased vehicles without telematics installed  
Purchased energy volumes are multiplied by country average emission factors 
for location-based emissions  For market-based emissions, the residual energy 
mix and purchased renewable energy instruments are the source of the emis-
sion factors used in the calculations  Part of the energy consumption at facili-
ties is estimated  See the footnote to the energy table above for details  
Emission factors used to calculate emissions in the categories Purchased 
goods and services, Capital goods, Fuel- and energy-related activities, Waste 
generated in operations, and End-of-life treatment of sold products are based 
on internal studies and Ericsson’s LCAs of the carbon footprint of its products, 
multiplied with relevant activity metrics to derive yearly emissions  
Emissions in the category Upstream transportation are calculated using 
a combination of calculations based on spend-based data, and calculations 
based on measured weights and transported distances of outbound shipments 
The majority of emissions in the category Business travel are based on data 
reported by travel agencies, with a smaller part including hotel nights being esti-
mated based on travel spend  Emissions in category Employee commuting are 
estimated based on a survey of employees’ commuting and teleworking habits  
Emissions in the category Use of sold products and services are calculated 
and reported in their entirety in the year a product is sold and not accrued 
over its expected lifetime  For the purpose of calculating these emissions, the 
average expected lifetime of products sold is assumed to be 10 years  Emission 
factors relevant to the use phase have been estimated using the current energy 
mix in the grids of markets served, or the latest available customer-specific 
energy mix data where that is stated in the public domain  Future changes 
in grid factors or customer-specific energy mixes that may occur over the 
expected lifetime of sold products is not factored into the calculations  
The majority of emissions in the category Downstream transportation are 
calculated using the weight and distances of transported products where the

Estimating Scope 3 emissions is associated with inherent uncertainties due 
to limitations in availability and accuracy of primary data, which is why the

Direct use-phase emissions through a hybrid method 
Scenario analysis for climate-related risks and opportunities Scenarios analyzed 
Net Zero 2050 – Ambitious mitigating actions introduced imminently – Net-zero global GHG emissions around 2050 – 50% chance of limiting global warming to below 1 5 °C by the end of the 
century – Relatively low physical risks but high transitional impacts 
Current Policies – Mitigating actions limited to currently adopted or announced policies – Emissions grow until 2080 – Global warming of around 3 °C by the end of the century – High physical risks but lower transitional impacts 
Initially, more than 30 potential climate-related risks and opportunities were 
considered in the analysis  The items on this longlist were identified through 
consultations with internal subject matter experts covering several company 
functions, and through external benchmarking  The probability and impact of 
all items were analyzed qualitatively through the usage of heatmaps  This was 
followed by a more granular analysis of a shortlist of risks and opportunities 
considered to be of highest relevance to Ericsson  Risks and opportunities 
upstream and downstream in the value chain, as well as in own operations 
were considered  Physical risks were mainly assessed using the assumptions 
under the Current Policies scenario, whereas transitional risks and opportuni-
ties were primarily analyzed in the context of the Net Zero 2050 scenario  Both 
scenarios are published by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for 
Regarding time horizons, the quantitative analysis of opportunities focused 
on the period up to 2025, and the quantitative analysis of risks on the period 
between 2025 and 2030  For the purpose of this analysis, Ericsson defined 
short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons as up to 2025, 2025-30, and 
beyond 2030, respectively  The more long-term impacts of risks and opportuni-
ties, stretching beyond 2030, were primarily assessed in a qualitative fashion  
Under the Current Policies scenario, the impacts of physical risks are expected

Ericsson has identified potential material impacts related to pollution both 
upstream and downstream in its value chain  As regards the upstream value 
chain, all manufacturing of electronic equipment today requires small volumes 
of substances of concern and sometimes substances of very high concern  
Downstream in the value chain, negative impacts can also occur if end-of-life 
products are not properly disposed of or recycled  Ericsson’s own manufactur-
ing processes primarily involve assembling products and components manu-
factured by other actors upstream in the value chain  Hence, no significant 
amounts of such substances are used in Ericsson’s own operations 
Fossil fuel energy generation is a significant source of air pollution  It is an 
indirect environmental impact from the electricity consumption of network 
equipment, which is especially relevant in markets where fossil energy sources 
make up a significant share of the energy mix  Increasing regulation on the use of certain substances may drive increased 
compliance costs as well as increased costs to research and develop alterna-
tive solutions and substances, exemplified with the recent proposal on restrict-
ing the use of PFAS1) in the European Union  In addition, the availability of 
alternatives may be limited, meaning they could come at a higher price than

Material impacts related to water have been identified upstream in the 
value chain, primarily linked to the manufacturing of semiconductors and 
extraction of natural resources such as minerals used in electronic hardware  
Semiconductor manufacturing requires high quality water  Often freshwater 
is used, which may cause impact on the water availability in adjacent com-
munities if not managed properly  Mining of minerals can impact water in 
several stages of the mining process, which may impact both the availability of 
Ericsson has not identified any material water-related impacts in its own 
operations or downstream in the value chain  Ericsson does not use water in 
its assembly processes, meaning water used at facilities is primarily used for 
sanitary purposes and comes from municipal water supplies  Freshwater is not 
directly drawn from ground or surface water sources  Ericsson’s products and 
As water is a key input in certain parts of Ericsson’s upstream value chain, 
water shortages affecting these parts of the value chain could lead to supply 
chain disruptions  Under the Current Policies scenario considered as part of 
Ericsson’s climate scenario analysis (see further details in note E1), several 
regions where Ericsson suppliers are located, including manufacturers of 
semiconductors in Southeast Asia, are at risk of high-water stress in the future, 
which could cause shortages of manufacturing inputs  
Ericsson’s Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners requires suppliers 
to reduce the use of natural resources, including water  The CoC is based on 
the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct with additional Ericsson-
specific requirements and is part of standard-supplier contracts  It is available 
For suppliers of hardware components or products, construction work, 
supply services, field maintenance and network rollout operations, as well as 
those with high environmental risks where their operations significantly impact 
the environment, Ericsson has additional environmental requirements  Among 
others, these require the supplier to measure and control emissions to water 
and ensure proper treatment of all effluents of wastewater  Further, suppliers 
shall control and measure their water usage  If water consumption is identified 
as a significant environmental aspect, the business partner must develop a 
water management plan to minimize the overall water consumption, recycle 
used water or by any other means reduce their impact 
Ericsson conducts audits of first-tier suppliers to verify adherence to the CoC  
Currently, the focus of the CoC audits as relates to water is on assessing sup-

Material impacts related to resource use and the transition to a circular 
economy have been identified upstream in the value chain, primarily linked to 
manufacturing of electronic equipment, as well as downstream in the value 
chain, related to the recovery and treatment of end-of-life electronic equip-
ment  Network equipment is manufactured using finite natural resources such 
as steel, aluminum, copper and rare earth minerals, as well as plastics  Metals 
are recycled to a high degree, in general, while rare earth metals and plastics 
have low recycling rates  Downstream in the value chain, the recovery and 
recycling rates of network equipment varies across regions  Product take-back 
levels are low because of the second-hand value of products, and the fact that 
the ownership resides with Ericsson’s customers  A large share of the network 
equipment is assumed to be resold and reused through informal second-hand 
markets  A smaller share is assumed to be recycled through substandard 
In its own operations, Ericsson primarily assembles parts and components 
from suppliers, which generates comparatively little material waste  Ericsson 
can, however, through product design, steer what materials are used by suppli-
ers to enable higher rates of recyclability, use of non-virgin materials and longer 
Redesigning products to meet customer or regulatory demands using 
alternative or non-virgin materials could lead to increased R&D costs  Scarcity 
of certain raw materials, including both virgin and non-virgin minerals, paired 
with increased demand in several industries for the same materials, could lead 
to higher costs of input materials and components used in electronic hardware  
Increased requirements on product take-back collection rates may lead to

dangerous goods, chemicals, hazardous waste and other substances or materi-
als posing a hazard to humans or the environment, as well as implement a 
systematic approach to identify, manage, reduce and responsibly dispose of or 
recycle non-hazardous solid waste  The supplier is also required to conserve the 
use of natural resources, including water, fossil fuels, minerals and virgin forest 
products, by practices such as modifying production, maintenance and facility 
processes, materials substitution, reuse, conservation and recycling

Ericsson utilizes the Design for the Environment principles and has generic 
product requirements in this area that apply to all product design processes  
These include specific requirements on ease of dismantling and disassembly 
of products to facilitate recycling  In addition, products are designed to be 
durable and have a high longevity, which is part of the quality process  The list 
of banned and restricted substances and the material declarations (see further 
details in note E2) are also important tools to design products that have a high 
grade of recyclability  The recyclability of products taken back has historically

E5  Reporting according to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation
According to Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation (the taxonomy), 
turnover, capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx) are 
defined as described below  For CapEx and OpEx, these definitions are dif-
ferent compared with Ericsson’s financial reporting  The Company’s financial 
statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB,) and as endorsed by the EU  The basis of preparation of the financial 
statements is explained in note A1 to the consolidated financial statements  
Total turnover corresponds to net sales in the consolidated income statement 
Total CapEx corresponds to additions, including capitalized research and 
development costs, to balance sheet items property, plant and equipment, 
intangible assets, before any remeasurement, depreciation, amortization or 
impairment and excluding any changes in fair value but including the effect 
of business combinations, as specified in notes C1 and C2 to the consolidated 
balance sheet, complemented by additions/changes in IFRS16 classified 
right-of-use assets, as specified in note C3 to the consolidated balance sheet as 
presented in the Financial Report, part of the Annual Report  
Total OpEx corresponds to non-capitalized research and development costs, 
building renovation costs, short-term leases, maintenance and repair costs, as 
well as other indirect costs for the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, 
Turnover, CapEx and OpEx in accordance with the above definition and which 
is associated with eligible activities (see below) constitutes the basis for 
calculating the share of eligible turnover, CapEx and OpEx  Amounts recorded 
on product codes related to eligible activities have been used as the basis to 
calculate amounts of eligible turnover, CapEx and OpEx  A reconciliation of 
amounts has been performed to avoid any double-counting  
Changes in accounting policies or disclosures compared with the previous 
The adoption of the Environmental Delegated Regulation in 2023 has supple-
mented the taxonomy with additional economic activities  Ericsson has assessed 
several of these as relevant to include in its disclosures starting from the fiscal year 
2023  Comparative data for 2022 related to these activities has not been included  
Identifying economic activities relevant for the Company has required interpreta-
tions of the taxonomy as well as the delegated regulations  Ericsson’s interpreta-
tion is that for an economic activity to be considered taxonomy-eligible, it must: – Be, or be aimed at, generating external turnover – Meet the description of an activity included in one of the annexes to the 
Climate or Environmental Delegated Regulation, and – Have practically applicable technical screening criteria associated with it  
Based on this interpretation, turnover, OpEx and CapEx derived from activities 
meeting these criteria have been included as taxonomy-eligible in the key 
performance indicators presented below  Moreover, individually eligible CapEx 
and OpEx (see below) can also be added to the share of eligible and aligned 
CapEx and OpEx  However, there remains some uncertainty around how the 
taxonomy should be applied, and interpretations, as well as reporting practices, 
Activities in the telecommunication sector are not yet included in the Climate 
Delegated Regulation of the taxonomy  The European Commission states 
in the Delegated Regulation that it may consider adding such activities and 
developing additional technical screening criteria in the future  However, at 
present most of Ericsson’s commercial offering to its customers, including 
mobile networks, is not covered by activities included as eligible activities in the 
Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions 
Ericsson offers artificial intelligence-powered and data-driven operations 
solutions, focusing on managing energy assets efficiently through intelligent 
site measurements and control, enabling customers to improve network energy 
efficiency, and consequently reducing energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions  This activity does not currently meet the associated technical screen-
ing criteria, and related turnover, CapEx and OpEx are therefore not reported 
Within all business areas, software development is part of Ericsson’s commer-
cial offering to its customers  Should expenditures associated with making this 
activity more resilient to the effects of climate change be incurred, these will be 
accounted for as either eligible CapEx or OpEx  Related turnover is not included 
in the share of eligible turnover since this activity is not classified as an enabling 
Ericsson has not incurred any expenditures of this nature during the report-

Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment 
Ericsson sells electronic equipment in the form of network hardware such as 
radios, antennas, basebands, power modules, routers and modems, and site 
materials such as cables and batteries  The equipment is manufactured both 
at own manufacturing sites and by third-party electronics manufacturers  
Equipment sold as part of a solution, but which Ericsson has not been involved 
in designing, such as laptops sold as part of a network (so-called third-party 
equipment), is excluded from eligible turnover as Ericsson does not have any 
significant influence over choice of input materials or over features such as 
Ericsson offers hardware support services to its customers, which includes 
Ericsson sells spare parts, including refurbished spare parts, for network equip-
It is permitted to include expenditures for purchases of products and services 
related to other economic activities than those stated above as eligible and aligned 
CapEx and OpEx, if these are included in either the Climate or Environmental 
Delegated Regulation, and if the economic activity of the supplier of the product 
or service in question is taxonomy-eligible and aligned, as applicable  Ericsson 
includes expenditures for motor vehicles (CCM 6 5), vehicle charging infrastructure 
(CCM 7 4), and energy-efficiency measures in buildings (CCM 7 3) as eligible and, 
where applicable, aligned CapEx and OpEx  As the assessment of alignment of 
these activities requires detailed information about the suppliers' own taxonomy 
alignment, Ericsson is currently not able to assess to what extent identified indi-
vidually eligible CapEx and OpEx can be considered to also be taxonomy-aligned  
Minimum safeguards are yet to be assessed in detail  Ericsson’s policies and 
procedures to prevent bribery, corruption and anticompetitive behavior are 
detailed in note G2 and its policies and procedures as relates to human and

Ericsson’s Sustainability policy is the Company’s foundation for environmental 
management  The policy articulates, among other things, that Ericsson shall 
use LCA methodology to determine its significant environmental aspects and 
to assess the environmental impact of ICT, that it shall reduce the negative 
environmental impact of its own operations and take a precautionary approach 
to environmental challenges and apply design to ensure continuous environ-
mental improvements with a life-cycle perspective regarding its portfolio 
In adherence with the Sustainability policy, Ericsson continuously strives 
to minimize the negative impacts of its own operations  The Company’s 
Environmental Management System (EMS) is certified to the ISO 14001:2015 
standard, covering management, research, product management, develop-
ment and supply, sales and installation, and maintenance of hardware, 
software, services and solutions for ICT  The EMS, as an integrated part of the 
Ericsson Group Management System, builds on Group-wide processes such as 
audits and assessments as well as management reviews  
Environmental aspects are assessed to identify those that are significant, 
which forms the basis for setting targets  Environmental regulation is periodi-
cally monitored and evaluated on a country level to ensure that Ericsson meets 
In addition to Ericsson´s Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, 
a specific Environmental Risk Management framework, which is aligned to 
ERM, is in place  The Company has an incident reporting system through which 
employees and suppliers are encouraged to report environmental incidents  
Incident reporting is part of the environmental requirements for suppliers 
included in the Ericsson Code of Conduct for Business Partners 
1) A signiﬁcant environmental incident is deﬁned as an unplanned event that has resulted in, or may 
result in, severe long-term negative environmental impact, including impact on air, water, land, natural 
As part of its analysis of material impacts, risks and opportunities, Ericsson 
has assessed its impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems  The conclusion of 
this analysis was that the main drivers of loss of biodiversity and degrada-
tion of ecosystems on which Ericsson and its value chain has an impact are 
climate change, use of natural resources and air pollution  These impacts, and 
Ericsson’s approach to addressing them, are further described in notes E1 to E4  
Other main drivers of biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystems are 
changes in land and sea use as well as the introduction of invasive species  
Ericsson did not identify any material impacts related to these two drivers in 
the ICT industry in general or in Ericsson’s value chain in particular through its 
materiality analysis  Ericsson’s facilities, including offices, data centers, test 
labs and production sites, are located in urban or semi-urban areas with limited 
impact on land use and surrounding ecosystems  In some instances, Ericsson 
supports customers when building telecommunication sites  In such cases, 
Ericsson’s standard procedures include considering location selection as part of 
Consequently, Ericsson addresses its biodiversity-related impacts through 
its efforts within climate change mitigation, work to reduce pollution, and its 
transition to a circular economy  Biodiversity, including ecosystems, is therefore 
not managed or reported on as a standalone matter  
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023
With a workforce of around 113,000 people located in more than 110 coun-
tries, counting both employees and the external workforce, Ericsson has identi-
fied several impacts related to its own workforce  
In several of the countries where Ericsson operates and has a significant 
share of its workforce there are heightened risks of violations of international 
conventions on labor rights and decent working conditions, as well as weak 
enforcement of local labor laws such as adequate wages, excessive work-
ing time and the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of association  
Countries and regions with heightened risks in one or several of these areas 
include, but are not limited to, China, India, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and 
Africa, and parts of Latin America  This means Ericsson must ensure its local 
employment policies and practices provide for secure and fair working condi-
tions for its workforce globally and in these markets in particular  
While diversity and inclusion are global challenges, several of the aforemen-
tioned countries have higher risks of discrimination at work and non-respect 
of women’s and minority rights  The ICT sector globally has a below average 
share of women in the workforce as well as in leadership roles  Within Ericsson, 
women today make up about 26% of all employees and 23% of managers  
In recent years, Ericsson has had no substantiated cases of discrimination 
at work, and Ericsson performs above the benchmark when employees are 
surveyed on whether they believe the Company provides a workplace where 
people are given the same opportunities regardless of their background and if 
they are treated with respect and dignity  Nevertheless, Ericsson must remain 
vigilant and continue to promote an inclusive culture based on mutual respect, 
Ericsson provides relevant training and development programs to its work-
force, ensuring that employees build critical skills and that the company is an 
attractive employer  This applies to both skilled professionals working in R&D 
and commercial areas, as well as professionals in many other job roles and 
Impacts related to the health, safety and well-being of Ericsson’s employees 
How Ericsson manages its workforce, and how it is perceived as an employer 
by current and potential employees, can affect its abilities to attract and retain 
key talent, which in turn can impact the Company’s competitiveness, ability 
to innovate and efficiently execute on its strategy  Workforce-related factors 
such as diversity and inclusion are also increasingly part of customers’ supplier 
evaluation processes, meaning Ericsson’s performance in this area could have 
an effect on how the Company is assessed in tenders and proposals  Ericsson’s 
ability to upskill and reskill its workforce in critical areas can also affect the 
Company’s ability to secure its strategic priority of technology leadership 
Ericsson’s Code of Business Ethics (CoBE), applicable to all people working for 
Ericsson, outlines the Company’s position on being committed to fostering an 
inclusive and supportive workplace where people can reach their full potential 
with respect for the dignity of every human being and in accordance with 
all internationally recognized human rights, including those outlined in the 
International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s 
Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  All forms of dis-
crimination are prohibited, even if local law permits it, including discrimination 
based on factors such as race, color, gender, language, religion, political affili-
ation, national or social origin, pregnancy or parental status, disability, marital 
status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and or expression, transgender 
status, health status, trade union membership or any other characteristic  
Anchored on the CoBE is the People Group Policy, which further articulates 
that Ericsson is committed to equal opportunity in employment, development, 
compensation, benefits and all other personnel actions without discrimination  
The principles set out in the policy include, but are not limited to the idea that 
every individual’s employment opportunities shall be based on openness and 
fairness, and that pay and recognition will reward impact and be based on the 
principles of competitiveness, fairness and transparency  
A portion of the variable remuneration to executives is determined by perfor-
mance on the Company’s target to increase the share of women in line man-
ager positions  See page 7 of the Remuneration report for further information  
Ericsson’s ability to attract, develop and retain talent is largely determined by 
the experience it provides for its people  Ericsson strives to enable employees 
to realize their full potential, and in doing so, create long-term value for the 
business  Focal points of the strategy are culture and leadership, diversity and 
inclusion, fair and competitive rewards, career development, and well-being  
Ericsson’s People Strategy is governed by Ericsson’s Global People Leadership 
Team, headed by the Chief People Officer, with the team having responsibility 
for strategy formulation and execution  Subject matter experts develop 
Group-wide core processes that are embedded throughout business areas 
and market areas, and other Group functions by unit people leaders  A global 
People Services unit supports delivery, ensuring consistent practices across the 
A strong company culture with defined core values and key behaviors is a pre-
requisite for both a positive people experience and for successfully executing 
on business strategies  The cornerstone of Ericsson’s culture are the following 
four core values: – Professionalism: Building trust by delivering on promises – Respect: Listening and caring with authenticity – Perseverance: We continually challenge ourselves to be at the forefront 
of innovation – Integrity: Making transparent, honest and uncompromising decisions 
Ericsson’s key behaviors, which are called the Five Focus Areas, were intro-
duced as part of a major culture transformation initiative  Each employee is 
expected to live the core values and demonstrate the Five Focus Areas consist-
approaches, enabling people to bring their unique perspec-

Results are summarized on both Group and unit level for managers and leaders 
to be able to act when and where appropriate  See note S2 for information 
about occupational health and safety committees in which both employer and 
Employees are expected to report concerns related to corruption, fraud, 
accounting, internal controls, discrimination and harassment, human rights or 
other matters that could constitute a breach of law, or that could harm the busi-
ness or reputation of Ericsson, its employees and shareholders, directly to their 
manager, the superior of a manager or to the People or Legal and Compliance 
departments  In addition, concerns can be raised via the Ericsson Compliance 
Line, either through a secure website or by telephone at any time, see further 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023 
Ericsson fosters a work environment based on respect  Treating colleagues 
with respect, dignity and inclusion brings out the best in everyone and is the 
right thing to do  At Ericsson, there is no room for harassment, threats, bullying 
or violence against anyone regardless of their position or seniority, and all 
forms of harassment, threats and acts of violence are prohibited  
Ericsson is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive organization, 
as this is core to the Company’s values and helps ensure that it attracts the 
best global talent, fosters innovation, and brings greater value to customers  
Accountability for diversity and inclusion sits with all leaders at Ericsson 
including the CEO and Executive Team, with strategy led by the Global People 
Leadership Team  Each business area, market area and Group function 
has a dedicated diversity and inclusion lead responsible for driving strategy execution and performance 
Ericsson aims to achieve a greater gender balance alongside increasing 
the representation of currently underrepresented groups  To achieve this, 
Ericsson focuses on creating unbiased people processes so that, for example, 
job advertisements use gender-neutral language, and on upskilling employees 
in inclusive leadership through training programs  
Ericsson supports a network of more than 42 employee resource groups 
throughout the organization including but not limited to sexual orientation, 
gender, age, families, health, and well-being  It also provides career develop-
ment programs focused on removing barriers to progression for these groups  
At Ericsson, the guiding principle is that people should be paid in a fair way and 
be recognized and rewarded for the impact that they create  Consequently, pay 
and benefits offered are market competitive and relevant to the individual with 
the aim to provide a broad reward offering to attract and retain talent and to 
keep employees feeling engaged, supported and rewarded 
Ericsson is consistent in its rewards offerings and works to ensure that pay 
decisions are non-discriminatory, based on the Company’s pay philosophy and 
always applied using the same criteria  There is a defined and globally consist-
ent job leveling and job architecture in place to ensure that pay is competitive 
and fair  To drive fairness and consistency and promote a culture of apprecia-
tion, the Company has put in place a global recognition program and platform  
The global job leveling and job architecture enable Ericsson to make mean-
ingful comparisons on pay, and the Company continues to refine its review of 
pay equity to identify where unexplained pay differences may exist  
Ericsson enables its people to develop skills and experience through on the job 
training and a focus on internal mobility  A set of critical skills areas necessary 
to execute on the growth strategy of extending leadership in mobile networks, 
and focused expansion into enterprise have been identified, including technol-
ogy, commercial and power skills  Learning and development opportunities 
connected to these critical skills range from introductory and fundamental, 
to experienced and advanced training, and are offered to upskill and reskill 
employees both for their job roles and to prepare for the future  Employees 
are offered internal job rotation opportunities, and Ericsson often first looks 
Upskilling and reskilling are further facilitated by a digital learning platform, 
which gives employees easy access to material and courses, and gives the 
Company a tool for tracking and analyzing progress and completions for meas-
Besides training and development programs in the scope of the critical skills 
areas, employees have access to a broad range of upskilling assets such as 
online internal and external courses and articles through the digital learning 
platform  Together with their managers, employees set individual annual and 
long-term career goals and learning plans  Employees also receive annual 
individual performance evaluations  The Company further emphasizes and 
recognizes those who participate in its Teach for Ericsson program, under-
standing that a teaching culture is essential to amplifying a learning culture  
Ericsson offers possibilities for remote working in a hybrid model to employees 
where job role and responsibilities allow for it  When possible, employees are 
also offered flexible working hours to help them balance work and personal 
commitments  For more information on approaches to well-being, see note S2  
Ericsson uses workforce planning and analytics to plan the workforce size and 
capabilities required to match current and future business needs and ensure 
that the right resources are in the right place at the right time and at the right 
cost  A People Analytics and Digital Solutions team provides analytics and 
insight to support leaders on both Group and unit level in making informed 
To further the policy objectives of inclusiveness and equal opportunity, Ericsson 
has set a target to increase the share of women among all employees, line 
managers and executive population, as outlined below

Besides employees, Ericsson also has an external workforce that does not have 
a direct employment relationship with the Company  This workforce is primarily 
made up of consultants working in the fields of service delivery, product devel-
opment and supply  Every year, Ericsson also offers internships to students and 
Ericsson respects the right of all employees to form or join independent trade 
unions as well as the right to collective bargaining  In places where local laws 
restrict these rights, Ericsson seeks other ways of having a meaningful dialogue 
with employees  This includes alternative, independent and freely elected 
forms of employee representation such as employee committees or councils  As 
for the rights of employees of suppliers, Ericsson’s requirements in this area are 
set out in its Code of Conduct for Business Partners  These requirements are on 
1) In 2023 and 2022 Ericsson mapped out the existence and coverage of collective bargaining agree-
ments in the 20 countries with the largest employee headcount  These countries cover approximately 
87 (86)% of the Group's total headcount  The share of employees covered stated above is based on 
this mapping, assuming the remaining unsurveyed 13 (14)% of the total headcount is not covered

Ericsson has identified material impacts within health, safety and well-being 
related to both its employees and employees of suppliers such as contractors 
and site services suppliers  In recent years, Ericsson has recorded several fatali-
ties among supplier employees, particularly within field operations, and two 
The two primary causes of these fatalities have been falling when working 
at heights and road traffic accidents, with the latter sometimes also involving 
fatal injuries to third parties such as members of the public  The same causes, 
together with manual handling and lifting, and working with electricity, 
represent most of the lost workday incidents recorded in recent years  These 
incidents have involved both own employees as well as supplier employees  
For the workforce not involved in field service-related activities, the main 
identified risks related to health and well-being are mental health problems 
caused by stress, anxiety and poor work-life balance, and musculoskeletal 
illnesses caused by, for example, repetitive or static work patterns or lifting 
objects  Ericsson has a responsibility to ensure the health, safety and well-
Work environment conditions such as health and safety are commonly 
included in customers’ supplier evaluation processes, meaning Ericsson’s 
performance in this area could affect how the Company is assessed in tenders 
Ericsson’s approach and commitments are set out in its Health, Safety, and 
Well-being policy, which states that the Company shall apply a risk-based 
approach to prevent, control and mitigate work-related hazards and risks, 
and continually improve its processes  Ericsson shall comply with customer 
and other applicable health and safety requirements that extend beyond 
legal compliance, even when these requirements exceed local legislation  
Further, Ericsson shall design workplaces and work processes, and provide 
tools that promote and support the health, safety and well-being of workers  
The Company shall provide necessary training and engage and consult with 
employees and other stakeholders to get input for continuous improvement 
of the health, safety and well-being management system  
Additionally, through its Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners, 
Ericsson sets requirements for occupational health and safety (OHS) for itself 
and its business partners, including suppliers  These requirements include 
taking a risk-based approach to health and safety, that employees are appro-
priately educated, trained and have the right experience to perform their tasks, 
and that appropriate incident reporting and investigation procedures are in 
place  For suppliers supplying construction, field maintenance, network rollout, 
warehouse services, or where otherwise included in the supplier contract, 
Ericsson has additional and more detailed OHS requirements in place to 
Health, safety and well-being is governed globally by two forums  The Global 
OHS Board, chaired by the Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, 
makes decisions and provides guidance on the OHS strategy and global 
programs  The Major Incidents and Performance Review Board, co-chaired 
by executives in the Managed Services and Networks organizations, reviews 
fatal and major incidents, root causes and actions taken, and follows up on 
performance and compliance  Both forums are mirrored in the market areas to 
promote consistency, alignment and accountability across the Group  
Ericsson drives a proactive agenda that goes beyond legal compliance, 
international standards and customer requirements to prevent work-related 
injuries and illnesses  The Ericsson Care program is the company’s overarching 
approach for its health, safety and well-being efforts to reach Ericsson's target 
of zero fatalities and lost workday incidents  See below for more information 
about this target  Annual health, safety and well-being risk and opportunity 
assessments are conducted to identify strategic risks as well as the recurring 
risks and opportunities  These assessments are aligned to the Enterprise Risk 
The Company’s OHS management system is a part of the Ericsson Group 
Management System and is designed to mitigate health, safety and well-being 
risks, as well as capture and implement opportunities for improvement in these 
areas across Ericsson’s business and processes  It is certified to ISO1) 45001, 
All people working for Ericsson are provided with the authority, responsibility 
and obligation to stop their own work or intervene in other’s work in situations 
where there is a belief that there is imminent danger of life-threatening injury or 
serious illness  Such cases shall be reported using the incident reporting process 
described below  Work shall only recommence once the risk has been mitigated 
and the workplace is safe  People applying Stop Work Authority shall not be 
criticized or penalized in any way  Ericsson does not accept any form of retalia-
tion toward a person stopping their work or reporting a related case  
Ericsson has a global incident reporting tool for reporting hazards, near misses 
and incidents involving employees, suppliers and anyone working on behalf 
of Ericsson supporting its operations  Concerns related to remote working can 
also be reported through this tool  Reported incidents are investigated by per-
forming a root-cause analysis to remedy any damage and prevent recurrence  
Ericsson has specific OHS requirements for suppliers that are part of contracts, 
and it is continuously strengthening its processes to improve safety perfor-
mance in its supply chain  The Company has introduced a supplier safety 
maturity assessment process to qualify suppliers against a set of predefined 
criteria  Based on the maturity assessment, an improvement plan is developed 
and shared with the supplier  Completion of actions in the improvement plan is 
aimed at helping suppliers improve their safety performance and maturity, and 
each supplier should complete assigned actions within set timelines  Ericsson 
applies consequence management to suppliers who do not close their actions 
in time or refuse to complete or be part of the assessment  
Site services suppliers failing to adhere to Ericsson’s health and safety 
requirements are handled through a consequence management process  To 
mitigate the risk of repeated failure of suppliers to follow rules and procedures, 
Ericsson imposes consequences such as financial penalties, reduction of busi-
ness volumes, more quality inspections and audits, and written warnings  In 
severe cases, supplier relationships can be terminated 
Ericsson has established OHS committees that include managers and employ-
ees, or employee representatives where such exist  The committees meet on 
a regular basis, follow up on OHS performance, and discuss and decide on 
actions for improvement of the OHS management system and its processes  
Communication around health, safety and well-being targets, performance, 
programs and training is available for all employees through internal channels 
Employees are asked yearly about health, safety and well-being through 
an annual employee survey, which includes questions about their perceptions 
of the Company’s efforts within health, safety and well-being, as well as their 
Ericsson has a dual approach for well-being made up of a combination of 
organizational components and individual areas  The organizational compo-
nents draw on the growing understanding of the conditions that enable health 
and well-being and the benefits of good work and include: 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023 
– Supportive workplace environment: An inclusive environment in which jobs 
are designed to consider physical, social and emotional well-being – Leadership advocacy: Safety and well-being behaviors role-modeled by 
leaders to drive accountability at all levels of the Company 
The individual areas are interrelated and comprise: – Physical: Maintaining healthy habits in fitness, nutrition, disease prevention 
and rest – Emotional: Good mental health and work-life balance, taking time to discon-
nect and recover, managing stress, and adapting to and coping with change – Financial: Being financially resilient, educated and confident to make 
financial decisions so that employees are prepared for the unexpected and 
on track for their future plans – Social: Sense of belonging, respect and feeling of purpose in career and life 
Ericsson allows for hybrid and flexible working arrangements, which facilitates 
greater autonomy for employees on where and when they perform their work  
A home furniture package is provided to improve ergonomics for hybrid work-
ing employees, aimed at preventing musculoskeletal ill-health caused by poor 
posture  Ericsson offers confidential counselling and well-being support online 
or via telephone through an external employee assistance program provider  
All Ericsson employees and employees of site services suppliers are required 
to take health, safety and well-being induction training  Additional training 
is required based on a person’s role and risk exposure to ensure adequate 
competence needs are met  Further, targeted web-based training that covers 
safe driving awareness and lifesaving rules1) is available to all employees and 
suppliers  Ericsson has a safety leadership training program for leaders within 
three levels of the CEO including Executive Team members and selected key 
roles that have a direct impact on operational safety  
Ericsson’s Walk the Talk guide also encourages all leaders to conduct regular 
safety and well-being walks by personally visiting a site and having a conversa-
tion exclusively about health, safety and well-being  
There is a mental health awareness and well-being training program in 
place which comprises: – An online course on musculoskeletal health available to all employees on the 
importance of behaviors that alleviate injuries  – An online course aimed at line managers and those in select key roles 
to improve their understanding of how to manage mental health in the 
workplace  – Webinars available to all employees on how to improve self-care for mental 
health and well-being, information on prevalent diseases such as cardio-
vascular and diabetes, and financial well-being  – A learning guide aimed at leaders on the connection between well-being 
and productivity, safety and performance, and how leaders can enhance

Ericsson has identified material impacts related to human rights in both its 
upstream and downstream value chain, as well as in its own operations  The 
analysis of impacts has been informed by Ericsson’s prior stakeholder con-
sultations, due diligence practices and analysis of business relationships  The 
material impacts related to human rights identified and described below are 
largely the same as the identified salient human rights issues across Ericsson’s 
Ericsson has an extensive supply chain with a global presence  Many sup-
pliers and subcontractors are found in countries and regions including, but not 
limited to, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, and Latin America, where there are 
heightened risks of workers not being paid an adequate wage or having secure 
employment conditions, working excessive hours, not being provided with 
adequate housing, or their right to freedom of association not being respected  
Similarly, in largely the same geographies, there are heightened risks of 
discrimination and harassment of women and other underrepresented groups 
or minorities in the workplace  Beyond its first-tier suppliers, Ericsson has also 
identified heightened risks of forced and child labor, in particular for activities 
involving the extraction of natural resources used in Ericsson’s hardware, as 
well as electronics manufacturing in certain parts of the world including, but 
Ericsson also has its own workforce and works with suppliers and subcon-
tractors in several countries with heightened risk to personal security caused by 
conflicts, civil unrest, criminality or authoritarian rule  
Downstream in the value chain, the material impacts identified relate to how 
misuse of the company’s technology and solutions could create risks of nega-
tive impacts on the right to privacy of end users, through functionalities where 
governments and authorities can intercept private communications, so-called 
lawful intercept  While Ericsson, as a network vendor company, does not hold 
a license and does not receive requests directly from authorities, it could be 
obliged by authorities to shut down networks where it operates these on behalf 
of service providers, which could impact people’s right to exercise their freedom 
of expression  The potential severity and likelihood of both these impacts 
correlate with the strength of rule of law, the regulatory environment and 
robustness of democratic institutions in the countries where Ericsson deploys 
Ericsson is involved in the development of new technologies such as 6G and 
artificial intelligence (AI)  The application and unintended effects on people 
and communities of such technologies are under increasing scrutiny, govern-
mental regulation, litigation, and the subject of public debate  Ericsson has 
therefore identified technology ethics as another human rights-related area 
In addition to the material impacts described here, additional identified 
impacts related to Ericsson’s own workforce are described in note S1, health 
and safety-related impacts in note S2, and impacts related to labor rights in the 
supply chain in note G3  More details on human rights risks and considerations 
in Ericsson’s value chain can be found in the 5G Human Rights Assessment, 
Existing and emerging legal requirements on companies to ensure respect for 
human rights across their value chains, in particular mandatory due diligence 
provisions such as those included in the US anti-forced labor import laws and 
the anticipated Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence directive in Europe, 
require companies to strengthen their measures in the area, which can increase 
compliance-related costs  Failure to demonstrate compliance can have both 
legal and financial consequences, as well as affect Ericsson’s access to certain 
markets  Human rights-related factors are also increasingly included in custom-
ers’ supplier evaluation processes, meaning Ericsson’s performance in this area 
could have an effect on how the Company is assessed in tenders and proposals 
Ericsson’s Business and human rights statement describes the Company’s 
commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights, including 
those outlined in the International Bill of Human Rights and the International 
Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at 
Work, and how the Company works to embed the UN Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) throughout its business operations  
The statement also describes Ericsson’s commitment to providing grievance 
mechanisms in line with the UNGP's effectiveness criteria and access to rem-
edy in cases when Ericsson has caused or contributed to adverse human rights 
impacts, engaging with stakeholders and rights holders to identify and mitigate 
potential adverse impacts in the development of new technologies and 
services, undertaking external assessments of the implementation of human 
rights principles and generally tracking the effectiveness of the Company's 
actions, and providing for transparent reporting  It also clarifies Ericsson’s 
commitment to invest in training and awareness on human rights for both 
employees and business partners  The commitment to respect internationally recognized human rights is 
further incorporated in Ericsson’s Code of Business Ethics (CoBE) available to 
the Company’s workforce in more than 40 languages  While the Business and 
human rights statement outlines the process of human rights due diligence, the 
CoBE specifically addresses Ericsson's most salient human rights issues includ-
ing non-discrimination, just and favorable conditions of work such as living 
wages and adequate rest and leisure, the right to form and join trade unions 
and bargain collectively, the company’s prohibition of forced labor, child labor 
and human trafficking, and the right to privacy and freedom of expression  
As a member of the Global Network Initiative (GNI), Ericsson is committed 
to the GNI Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy 
Ericsson’s Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners requires Ericsson 
and its business partners to respect all internationally recognized human 
rights standards, including the International Bill of Human Rights and the 
principles concerning fundamental rights set out in the International Labor 
Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work  
The CoC is based on the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct but 
also includes Ericsson-specific requirements and is a part of standard supplier 
contracts  It is available in several languages on the Company’s website

Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023 
The area of business and human rights is managed by the Sustainability and 
Corporate Responsibility (S&CR) unit  Within the S&CR unit sits human rights 
subject matter experts, responsible for developing the Company’s human rights 
strategy and for supporting the business and market areas and Group functions 
in the implementation of the strategy and commitments  
To operationalize its commitments to respecting human rights, the Company 
has integrated human rights due diligence across its business operations  The 
aim is to ultimately provide better outcomes for people across the value chain 
and ensure the Company’s technology is a force for good, by preventing and 
mitigating intended and unintended misuse  Ericsson’s S&CR strategy, part 
of its wider business strategy, incorporates its commitment to the UNGPs and 
compliance to existing and emerging regulation in the area of human rights  
Human rights risks are also included in Ericsson’s Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework and overseen by the Business Risk Committee  In addition to the 
information below, additional details on Ericsson’s human rights due diligence 
efforts and prioritized areas can be found in Ericsson’s Business and Human 
Rights Statement, available on the Company’s website 
In order to assess, prevent and mitigate potential misuse of Ericsson’s technol-
ogy, human rights due diligence is integrated into the sales process through the 
Sensitive Business Framework  The framework aims to ensure that Ericsson’s 
solutions are used in accordance with international human rights standards  
The Sensitive Business Framework is managed on an operational level by 
a dedicated team of sensitive business experts and governed by a cross-
functional forum with representatives from the business and market areas, and 
Group functions  Decisions, and the rationale behind those decisions, can be

When the initial risk screening identifies risks in a sales opportunity that is to be 
pursued, the market area shall submit an approval request, which is evaluated 
according to the Sensitive Business risk methodology and may be approved, 
approved with conditions or rejected  Conditional approvals include technical 
and or contractual mitigations  Implementation of these mitigations by the 
relevant market area is monitored to ensure adherence  Described below are 
examples of cases reviewed in this process during the reporting year  The

rights due diligence concerning the customer or country) before a decision is 
See note G3 for a description of how environmental, social and governance 
factors, including human rights, are considered in Ericsson’s supply chain 
Human rights issues are included as one aspect in Ericsson’s due diligence 
process for M&A  The focus is on evaluating main human rights risks of the 
target company, as well as to what extent the target company has sufficient 
due diligence frameworks in place to identify and address such human rights 
risks  In case red flags or gaps are identified, a mitigation plan including 
appropriate remediations  is required either as a precondition or as part of the 
When conducting business in conflict-affected areas or when human rights 
risks are otherwise considered elevated, enhanced due diligence is conducted  
Measures taken in such situations include engaging with external stakehold-
ers, including potentially affected stakeholders or their intermediaries and 
In conflict-affected or high-risk contexts, it may be difficult to reach out 
directly to impacted stakeholders  In such circumstances, Ericsson tries to 
leverage its engagement in forums such as the GNI and the Business Network 
on Civic Freedoms and Human Rights Defenders to identify ways of engaging 
with external stakeholders that ensure their personal security and safety  This 
can involve sharing information about current and future business activities 
and practices, potential human rights risks and mitigating measures, and how 
to establish meaningful communication channels with concerned stakeholders  
A standalone human rights impact assessment can also be triggered by 
factors such as reentry into a market, reports about deteriorating human rights 
situations in a specific country, new product developments or identified actual 
adverse impacts  The methodology used for conducting human rights impact 
Ericsson has operations in areas of high risk where, for example, armed 
conflicts, criminality and authoritarian rule can lead to situations that expose 
employees and the external workforce to heightened risk to their personal 
security  Ericsson monitors geopolitical and security threats worldwide and 
maintains security risk ratings for areas hosting Ericsson operations  The 
Company’s security strategy articulates the criticality of proactively and effec-
tively mitigating and managing such risk, which is operationalized through the 
deployment of a global framework for Security in High-Risk Areas  The objec-
tive of this framework is to enable business operations in high-risk areas while 
safeguarding employees, suppliers and anyone working on behalf of Ericsson 
supporting its operations through adequate and risk-based personal protection 
measures, for example: – Procedures, training and precautionary actions to minimize the risk of 
becoming the target of criminal activity  – Requirements on travel routes and transportation arrangement (e g , timing, 
travelling in convoys, use of armed security escorts, security precautions at 
stops, tracking of movements)  – Use of satellite telephones in remote locations  – Physical security requirements for accommodation and work locations 
Ericsson is involved in the development of new technologies such as 6G and AI, 
and its human rights-related policies and commitments apply also to the devel-
opment of new technologies  Ericsson adheres to the EU’s Ethics Guidelines 
for Trustworthy AI and has incorporated the guidelines in development and 
governance processes, including AI development guidelines and design rules  
The principles cover topics such as explainability, non-bias, non-discrimination 
and possibility of human oversight  Apart from the implementation of trustwor-
thy AI by design, Ericsson is also committed to ensuring that the company itself 
Internal and external stakeholders can report suspected violations of laws, 
regulations or company policies, including human rights violations, through the 
Ericsson Compliance Line  Reporting through this channel can be done anony-
mously  Ericsson does not require persons that report compliance concerns to 
waive their rights to bring claims through a judicial process as a condition to 
participating in the grievance process  As part of reporting a compliance con-
cern, either via a manager or through the Ericsson Compliance Line, Ericsson 
does not require the reporter to sign a non-disclosure agreement  The reporter 
is, however, asked not to share any communication relating to an ongoing 
matter, in order to protect the integrity of the process  More information can be

Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023
The number of internet users has increased from a few million to almost 5 bil-
lion within 30 years  This growth has enabled a digital transformation that 
is reshaping societies and economies  Research shows that, on average, a 10% 
increase in mobile broadband adoption can increase economic growth by up 
to 0 8% , with the effect being significantly larger in low-income countries1)  
Moreover, a 2022 study commissioned by Ericsson in 15 countries in Asia, 
Africa and Latin America also showed that 5G rollout can generate overall 
economic benefits (in terms of GDP growth) three-to-seven times higher than 
the incremental cost of extending coverage2)  Similarly, increases in school 
connectivity can have significant effects of economic growth, with potential 
double-digit additions to GDP if low-income countries achieve the same levels 
of connectivity as the most connected economies3)  While there was improve-
ment between 2022 and 2023, the potential of the internet for social and 
economic growth remains largely untapped, as 2 6 billion people or roughly 
one-third of the world’s population remains offline, and many among the two-thirds of the people online lack meaningful connectivity4) 
The connectivity gap is twofold and consists of both a gap in overall cover-
age, meaning access to any type of mobile broadband connection, and a gap in 
terms of lacking a mobile broadband connection that is good enough to allow 
full participation in the digital economy, such as access to at least 4G cover-
age  The challenge in bridging both these gaps is primarily a financial, rather 
than a technological, one with a need for new business models to evolve to 
enable meaningful connectivity at lower cost  Through solutions such as Fixed 
Wireless Access (FWA), Ericsson contributes to increased affordability, which 
is one enabler for connecting the unconnected and closing the digital divide  
Nearly one-quarter of the world’s adult population lacks access to formal 
banking and financial services, according to World Bank Findex  However, the 
majority of the unbanked population owns a mobile phone that can help them 
access formal financial services  Mobile financial services offer the possibility 
to bring millions of financially underserved people into the formal economy, 
improving individual livelihoods and transforming economies  In addition, 
without sufficient digital literacy people cannot fully partake in the digital 
economy regardless of whether they have a meaningful connection or not, 
which is why digital upskilling is another key enabler to achieve broad digital 
inclusion in society  Through its digital education program, Connect To Learn, 
Ericsson works with governments, communication service providers, non-gov-
ernmental organizations (NGOs) and international/UN agencies to accelerate 
access to digital connectivity for schools and learning centers, and to empower 
the next generation with digital skills to enhance industry-ready education and 
Ericsson’s Sustainability policy states that the Company shall engage in activi-
ties that have a positive social, environmental and economic impact on people, 
business and society and promote digital inclusion  In addition, Ericsson’s 
Human Rights policy articulates that the Company shall proactively promote 
human rights by working toward fulfillment of the positive potential of ICT for 
Ericsson’s approach is based on the belief that technology developed and 
deployed responsibly can help bridge the digital divide and ensure that the 
benefits of the digital economy and society are enjoyed by all  The Company 
works toward this goal through digital inclusion initiatives, which cover the 
portfolio, business cases, advocacy and on-the-ground efforts 
Ericsson continues to explore how its portfolio and offerings can be used to 
develop cost-efficient and profitable business offerings targeting regions 
with no or low internet penetration  The scope of these efforts includes radio 
and power management solutions as well as business cases and use case 
scenarios  FWA is one example of an efficient and scalable alternative to wired 
connections and a portfolio solution that can benefit institutional coverage, 
such as, for example, in schools  In recent years, a substantial share of new 5G 
Ericsson’s Mobile Wallet Platform enables leading communications service 
providers and financial institutions to provide easy to use, affordable and 
secure mobile financial services to financially underserved people worldwide, 
helping them lead a financially empowered life  It allows unbanked people to 
save and transfer money, receive financial aid and salary, pay bills and mer-
chants, top up mobile services, get instant loans, as well as access insurance 
Ericsson’s commitment to bridging the digital divide includes a focus on 
access to education and digital skills development  This is carried out through 
Ericsson’s global flagship education program, Connect To Learn, a non-profit 
program delivered in collaboration with governments, communications service 
providers, NGOs and international/UN agencies, with the ambition to: – Accelerate access to digital connectivity for schools and community learning 
centers and, ultimately, all learners around the globe and their communities  – Empower the next generation with digital skills, essential for their socio-
economic development and enhance industry-ready education to make

The Board of Directors oversees Ericsson’s S&CR strategy and receives reports 
on developments and performance annually, or more often as needed  The 
Board approves the annual S&CR report as part of the Company’s statutory 
In addition to the primary oversight exercised by the Board, each of the 
committees of the Board is involved, to some degree, in Ericsson’s S&CR 
strategy  The Audit and Compliance Committee oversees Ericsson’s Ethics 
and Compliance program and whistleblower procedures, and reviews the 
Group’s handling of information and cybersecurity, data privacy, and its 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting practices  The Finance 
Committee oversees the promotion of the S&CR strategy in external funding 
through the application of the Green Financing Framework  As part of its role 
to prepare and propose rewards and compensation policies that attract and

Ericsson maintains a robust approach to risk management  The Company 
has made significant strides toward ensuring that strategic, external and 
internal risks are properly identified, assessed, internally reported, escalated, 
and effectively addressed  As part of its enhanced approach to risk manage-
ment, Ericsson has established the Group Business Risk Committee (BRC) 
which is co-chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Legal Officer  
The BRC now serves as a fully embedded risk escalation and oversight forum 
which has strengthened management’s decision making and handling of risks  
The BRC applies a “heightened scrutiny” approach in evaluating and mitigating 
these types of risks, and the organization has implemented various actions to 
address these risks, ranging from enhanced contractual protections, changes 
to the scope or nature of operations, or decisions to responsibly exit relevant 
A portion of the variable remuneration to executives is determined by envi-

Officer, is accountable for developing and implementing strategies, policies, 
steering documents, targets and processes related to S&CR  Responsibility for 
executing on S&CR strategies and progressing on targets lies with the Group 
functions, business and market areas, often in cross-functional collaborations 
During 2023, Ericsson enhanced and clarified its Code of Business Ethics 
(CoBE), which is a core governance pillar  The updated CoBE sets out the 
Company’s expectations, principles and requirements for employees as they 
conduct business  It provides the framework for ethical decision-making, and 
guides employees in making decisions and managing risk as they engage with 
colleagues, customers, partners, owners, and other stakeholders  Ericsson’s 
Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners outlines expectations on Ericsson, 
its suppliers and other business partners in key areas such as business ethics 
and anti-corruption, labor and human rights, occupational health and safety, 
environment and climate change  It is a binding requirement for all business 
partners  Additional ESG-related policies are listed below  The main contents 
of the two codes and other policies as relates to material impacts, risks and 
opportunities are described in the topic-specific notes to this report  The CoBE 
is approved by the Board and the CoC and Group-wide policies are approved by

Corruption, bribery and unethical business practices are an obstacle to 
economic and social development, and often disproportionally affect fragile 
communities and undermine democratic institutions  They erode the trust that 
people and businesses have in institutions, and damage the business environ-
ment, causing long-term barriers to efficient economic activities in countries 
and regions where they occur, leading to lower levels of investments and 
reduced growth  Ericsson is a large multinational company with approximately 
100,000 employees worldwide, and customers in more than 180 countries  
With its global reach, Ericsson is present in emerging markets in Asia, Latin 
America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, including many countries 
with weaker institutions and that have a higher risk of bribery and corruption  
As described in more detail below, there have been historical instances 
where Ericsson failed to properly mitigate bribery and corruption risks  As a 
result, the Company incurred significant costs related to investigations, legal 
actions, compliance monitorship and fines, and suffered damage to its brand 
and reputation  Further violations of applicable anti-bribery and anti-corrup-
tion laws and regulations could have severe financial and reputational conse-
quences  Since 2019, Ericsson has made significant investments to strengthen 
its Ethics and Compliance (E&C) infrastructure, enhance its approach to 
governance and risk management and improve its corporate culture, overseen

The Company’s foundational values and principles are set out in the Code of 
Business Ethics (CoBE) available in over 40 languages  The CoBE articulates 
the Company’s commitment to conduct business with integrity and zero toler-
ance for bribery and corruption  It emphasizes that employees must disclose 
potential conflicts of interest, not partake in anti-competitive practices and only 
engage with vetted third parties who abide by the same standards of integrity 
as Ericsson  In addition to the CoBE, specific policies on: anti-corruption; gifts, 
entertainment and hospitality; third-party management; conflicts of interest; 
anti-money laundering; anti-trust law; and insider rules, among others, are in 
place to support Ericsson's employees in conducting business in compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations  These policies are supported by relevant 
internal controls and recurrent internal testing to ensure end-to-end oversight 
and an effective E&C program that reduces the probability of risks occurring 
Ericsson’s Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners articulates the 
Company’s expectations and anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) requirements 
for its business partners  It also makes clear that Ericsson expects its business 
partners to foster a culture of integrity based on transparency, compliance 
and ethical business practices  The CoC is based on the Responsible Business 
Alliance Code of Conduct but also includes Ericsson-specific requirements and 
is part of standard-supplier contracts  It is available in several languages on the

speaks up when there are violations or suspected violations of the CoBE  In 
turn, it expects that executives will drive the culture of integrity and compliance, 
encourage open discussions about ethics and compliance, and anticipate and 
mitigate potential compliance issues  As part of this effort to set the tone at the 
top, the CEO frequently sends email communications to all employees in which 
practical compliance challenges and related solutions are highlighted  
Ericsson’s E&C program consists of ten hallmarks – ranging from leadership 
and culture to mergers and acquisitions, rewards and sanctions – based on the 
expressed expectations of leading authorities with jurisdiction over Ericsson  
Ericsson’s Group Business Risk Committee, co-chaired by the Chief Legal 
Officer (CLO) and the Chief Financial Officer, serves as a fully embedded risk 
escalation and oversight forum which has strengthened management’s deci-
sion making and handling of risks  The BRC process and Group-wide assess-
ment of risk has enhanced the Company’s insights into enterprise risk and has 
increased alignment and the ability to effectively address risks which impact 
various parts of the organization  In particular, the BRC reviews potential risk 
matters with high impact (including risks which arise in “high risk” jurisdictions) 
and provides an internal management forum for monitoring and assessing 
risks identified in the enterprise risk management system  
The Audit and Compliance Committee (ACC) of the Board of Directors 
oversees matters relating to compliance risk and regularly receives reporting on 
compliance related matters from the CLO, the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) 
and the Head of Corporate and Government Investigations  The Compliance 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023
Office function at Ericsson is led by the CCO, who reports to the CLO  In addition 
to reporting to the CLO, the CCO has a further independent reporting line to the 
ACC on the areas of the E&C Program  The CCO regularly reports to the ACC on 
the effective operation of the E&C Program, including information of actual or 
suspected serious CoBE violations, insights from investigations outcomes and 
remediation activities, the identification of patterns of failures, and emerging 
risks and changes in the legal and regulatory environment  In addition, the CLO 
has a direct reporting line to the ACC on compliance matters that fall outside 
the scope of the E&C program, and on the holistic management of legal, 
compliance, ethical and associated reputational risks arising in the Company’s 
operations  The compliance organization consists of compliance officers at 
Group level and local compliance officers supporting the line organization  
In 2022, Ericsson created a standalone Competition and Antitrust Unit  
Originally part of the Compliance Office, in 2023 the Competition and Antitrust 
unit became part of the newly created Global Risk and Regulatory Policy unit 
Ericsson conducts bribery and corruption risk assessments using a risk-based, 
multitiered approach across multiple regions to identify areas of heightened 
risk  This typically includes document collection, review and analysis, on-site or 
remote interviews of key personnel, and financial transaction testing for select 
markets and units  Focus areas include but are not limited to leadership and 
culture, sales, third-party management, gifts, entertainment and hospitality, 
conflicts of interest, government relations, policies and procedures, corporate 
contributions, and joint ventures and partnerships  Further, end-to-end testing 
and monitoring of the E&C program is performed in cooperation between 
different assurance functions, such as the Control Monitoring Center within the 
Finance function, a Monitoring and Testing unit within the Compliance Office, 
Over the last few years, the Company has invested in digital capabilities to enable 
the employees, line managers and compliance professionals to work more 
efficiently, get easier access to compliance data and simplify the E&C program 
processes  Examples of the tools deployed include the E&C Portal (facilitating 
controls for conflict of interest, and gifts, entertainment and hospitality, includ-
ing benefits provided to and from third parties, particularly public officials), the 
Allegation Case Management System (handling the allegation management 
process end-to-end from intake to remediation) and third-party management 
(TPM) risk management tools  The digital landscape is continuously evolving, 
with emphasis on AI and analytics to further enhance risk management of 
Ericsson maintains a global, risk-based and integrated TPM program to 
prevent, detect and manage bribery and corruption risks in the Company’s 
relationships with its third parties  The management of third-party compliance 
risk is integrated into business processes, and business leaders, managers 
and individual contributors are all expected to act as owners of compliance 
risk  Components of the TPM program are managed by a central team of due 
diligence experts and data specialists  Key elements include a risk-based due 
diligence process to assess bribery and corruption risk exposure and potential 
liability that may result from relationships with third parties  A risk mitigation 
toolbox includes a broad range of measures that can be used to mitigate identi-
fied risks such as training, certifications, financial transaction preapprovals, or, 
TPM increasingly utilizes advanced data analytics and reviews business 
rationale at the transaction level, whilst focusing on monitoring risks through-
out the life cycle of business relationships  Business Partner Review Boards, 
comprised of senior business leaders and compliance professionals, regularly 
monitor the third-party risk landscape and provide approvals and mitigating 
actions on high-risk third parties on both market area and global levels  The 
effectiveness of underlying processes in each geography is continuously measured and strengthened, when necessary  
The purpose and objectives of Ericsson’s E&C training plan are to develop a 
robust risk-based training strategy for all employees, establish a sustainable 
model for face-to-face training initiatives, and provide employees with training 
on the Company’s compliance-related policies and procedures  Training clari-
fies to people working for the company what is expected in their roles, educates 
them on how to recognize bribery and corruption risks, and guides them on 
how to handle dilemma situations that arise in the course of their work  
To achieve these objectives, Ericsson has considered various learning styles 
to engage people and has created multiple training platforms, training material 
and communication assets to allow diverse and interactive training experience 
tailored to specific target groups and based on the level of risk exposure  
All employees and external workforce must complete foundational online 
ABC training courses every second year  Ericsson also provides mandatory 
enhanced ABC training for approximately 15,000 employees in high-risk roles, 
many of whom are also line managers  About 200 executives, including the 
Executive Team, are also provided with training in ethical dilemmas in a work-
shop format  The same type of training is also provided to other leaders on an 
ongoing basis as part of broader leadership training or as standalone training 
for intact teams  The CoBE promotes and supports Ericsson’s Speak-Up Culture 
and prohibits retaliation for speaking up in any form  All employees are required 
to confirm their understanding of the CoBE on a regular basis  
Employees are regularly asked about how they perceive Ericsson’s commit-
ment to compliance, business ethics and anti-bribery and corruption  The 
annual employee survey includes questions about their perception of the 
Company’s commitment to ethical and responsible business practices, as 
well as whether they feel free to speak their mind without fear of negative 
All employees have a goal related to acting with integrity, which encom-
passes a number of specific actions that must be satisfied annually  Failure to 
meet any of these specific requirements has a negative impact on the outcome 
As part of the commitment to a compliance culture, Ericsson has a standalone 
Competition and Antitrust Unit driving the Company’s Competition and 
Antitrust program, which is currently being strengthened after an antitrust 
audit  Employees are asked to recognize competition (antitrust) laws and 
comply with them  Given the complexity of competition laws, employees are 
encouraged to consult with the competition law attorneys in the Company’s 
Employees are expected to report concerns related to corruption, fraud, 
accounting, internal controls, human rights matters or other matters that could 
constitute a breach of law, or that could harm the business or reputation of 
Ericsson, its employees and shareholders directly to their manager, the superior 
of a manager or to the People or Legal and Compliance departments  In addi-
tion, the Company promotes transparency through the maintenance of the 
Ericsson Compliance Line, a dedicated communication channel for employees 
and external stakeholders to report any compliance concerns either by a secure 
website or by phone  The Ericsson Compliance Line is operated by a third 
party and is available 24/7, 365 days per year, and enables reporting from 
multiple countries in several languages, and anonymously if so chosen  Where 
applicable, Ericsson employees and external stakeholders have the option to 
report certain matters via local channels, which have been implemented in 
accordance with the European Union Directive on the protection of persons 
who report breaches of Union law  The process for receiving and handling 
compliance concerns is designed to help maintain an appropriate degree of 
independent assessment  Ericsson does not accept any discrimination of, or 
retaliation against, individuals who report compliance concerns in good faith  
In addition, the Company has increased the frequency at which it publishes 
its Speak Up Newsletter, featuring anonymized examples of actual misconduct 
and the way any such misconduct was addressed by the Company  The Speak 
Up Newsletter also includes short stories highlighting situations in which 
employees facing difficult choices chose to do the right thing   Progress in the 
Speak Up culture in recent years can be seen in the increased raising of compli-
ance questions and potential concerns by Ericsson’s employees  The willing-
ness by Ericsson’s employees to speak up is an essential safeguard to ensure

Ericsson has a global supply chain with around 20,000 first-tier suppliers  
About 2,000 of these make up more than 90% of the supplier spend, and 
around 200 suppliers of the total supplier base are providers of hardware 
The global electronics supply chain is long and complex  In simple terms, it 
begins with the extraction of natural resources used in electronics manufactur-
ing, which are then sold and transported to smelters and refiners for processing  
The refined materials are traded and exchanged, and subsequently used in the 
manufacturing of parts and components, which are assembled into finished 
Manufacturing and assembly of Ericsson’s electronic hardware takes place 
both at Ericsson’s own sites and at third-party electronic manufacturing 
services sites  In addition, a limited number of modules are manufactured by 
original/joint design manufacturing suppliers supporting specific market and 
Ericsson’s supply hubs are regional distribution centers for logistics opera-
tions to serve customer orders and customer projects efficiently with activities 
like the collection of deliveries from production units and suppliers, warehous-
ing, co-packing, order configuration and transport optimization  Regional 
inbound (component) hubs consolidate material from component suppliers, 
and these are a central point of component supply to the production sites, 
creating resilience and flexibility in the inbound supply chain

Ericsson contributes and is linked to several impacts through its business and 
supplier relationships  Material environmental impacts related to the upstream 
value chain are primarily greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from resource 
extraction, manufacturing and transportation, use of natural resources and 
possible inclusion of banned or restricted substances in Ericsson’s hardware, 
as well as freshwater use in primarily resource extraction activities as well as in 
semiconductor manufacturing  More information on these impacts is available 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023 
For social factors, the main material impacts identified upstream in the supply chain relate to equal treatment and opportunities, occupational 
health and safety (OHS), freedom from discrimination, forced and child labor, 
substandard working conditions as well as the security of workers in the value 
chain  More information on these impacts is available in notes S2 and S3  
Additionally, with a complex and global supply chain come risks of a part-
ner's business conduct not being aligned to a company’s own values, principles 
and standards  Ericsson has identified material impacts relating to corruption 
and bribery in its upstream value chain  More information on this is available in 
Ericsson’s Code of Conduct (CoC) for Business Partners is the foundation for 
the Company’s work with responsible sourcing  The CoC covers four main 
areas: anti-corruption and business ethics, human and labor rights, safe and 
healthy working conditions, and environmental management  In addition, and 
covering all these areas, there is a requirement on suppliers to have an estab-
lished management system  Business partners must also ensure and monitor 
that their suppliers and subcontractors comply with the CoC, or other agreed 
equivalent standards  The CoC is based on the Responsible Business Alliance 
(RBA) Code of Conduct but also includes Ericsson-specific requirements and is 
part of standard-supplier contracts  It is available in several languages on the 
Company’s website  More detailed descriptions on the requirements in the CoC 
relating to identified material impacts are included in notes E1 to E4, S2 and S3 
Alongside the CoC, specific environmental and OHS requirements on business 
partners and suppliers involved in certain activities with higher environmental 
impact or with higher risks to workers' health and safety are also part of relevant 
supplier contracts and can also be accessed through the Company’s website 
Ericsson segments its supplier base to efficiently manage and prioritize supplier 
relationship management activities, optimize value from the supplier base 
as well as manage risks  Suppliers are segmented into one of four categories 
based on a combination of the following four aspects: spend, risk, dependency 
and value  Suppliers in the top two categories are considered business critical  Ericsson strives to have dual supply sources to strengthen the supply chain 
resilience wherever possible  The company also invests in strategic buffers 
to further reduce the risk of disruptions  In addition, the Company monitors 
disruptive events in real time and offers suppliers to be visualized in the moni-
toring process  In case such an event occurs, Ericsson will be notified of which 
suppliers may be impacted  The risks and potential severity are subsequently 
assessed, and based on supplier input about its impacts and internal insights 
into the supply chain, mitigation activities for the specific event will be enacted  
The real-time monitoring can be extended to integrate a supplier’s business 
continuity plans, enabling additional granularity in the analysis of the supplier’s 
Within Ericsson’s sourcing organization, a dedicated unit is responsible for 
driving sustainability-related initiatives and with a focus on supplier alignment 
with environmental and OHS expectations, as well as adherence to the CoC 
in the supply chain  The scope of the Responsible Sourcing program mirrors 
the topics covered in the CoC  This work is aligned with the Sustainability 
and Corporate Responsibility strategy and is an integrated part of the supply 
chain strategy  Supplier adherence to standards and requirements is verified 
through two audit programs, one based on the CoC and the other on contract 
Ericsson has a process for assessing its first-tier suppliers for risk of non- 
conformity with its CoC  A modular supplier sustainability risk assessment 
based on the supplier category's risk profile is triggered during the supplier 
onboarding process and for selected active suppliers  The scope of each 
assessment is predefined based on the type of products or services the supplier 
provides  Once a supplier has been selected for assessment, one or several 
self-assessment questionnaires covering environmental, OHS and human 
rights management are sent to the supplier for completion  The supplier shall 
also provide supporting documentation for its responses  Suppliers are subse-
quently rated as having high, medium, or low risk, depending on how well they 
meet Ericsson’s criteria in the assessed area(s)  Based on this rating, a recom-
mendation to either approve, not approve , or approve the supplier with certain 
conditions to address gaps (or the equivalent recommendations in the case of 
Suppliers’ environmental performance and audit findings closure status are 
monitored via supplier performance cards together with other criteria such as 
quality and timely deliveries  Supplier performance evaluations are primarily 
done for top segmented suppliers as a recurrent activity to drive performance 
improvements  Ericsson has implemented a consequence management pro-
cess for site services suppliers, where OHS incidents are most frequent  There 
Suppliers in focus of this program are first-tier suppliers and primarily those 
making up the top 90% of Ericsson’s supplier spend  The inherent risk of these 
suppliers – based on factors such as purchase volume, country, type of service 
or product supplied and time since the last audit – is assessed and forms the 
basis for audit selection  The audits are performed by a contracted third-party 
audit firm and are done primarily on-site, with remote audits being an option 
for high-risk countries  The overall audit criteria is adherence to the CoC, with 
specific criteria including, but not being limited to, employment conditions such 
as working hours, wages and management dialogue, OHS matters such as 
accident and incident prevention, chemical handling as well as communication 
Non-conformities are required to be addressed through time-specific correc-
tive action plans  Since the CoC is part of standard supplier contracts, suppliers 
failing to adhere to it may have their contracts terminated  Ericsson does not 
Ericsson also conducts audits to verify compliance to contractual agree-
ments between suppliers and Ericsson  These are performed by Ericsson’s 
internal auditors and follow the principles of ISO 9011 Guidelines for Auditing 
Management Systems  Besides the CoC, other criteria such as trade compli-
ance, business continuity management and security are in the scope of these 
audits  Non-conformities are required to be addressed through time-specific 
Ericsson is a member of the RBA and is working to increase the share of 
participating suppliers, and to make further use of its audit programs and other 
Ericsson offers free training through its website to its suppliers and business 
partners  Besides general training on the CoC, targeted content covering anti-
corruption, human rights, conflict minerals and OHS is also available via the 
Company’s website  For suppliers in scope of the supplier engagement target, 
Ericsson offers training on climate change mitigation  
A set of training modules has been created for all sourcing employees focus-
ing on environmental requirements and how to guide suppliers to drive climate 
action  Direct access to the United Nation Global Compact and Sustainable 
Development Goals training academies is available to employees in the sourc-
ing organization as well as to suppliers via Ericsson’s website  
Ericsson bases its approach on sourcing of minerals and metals on the OECD 
Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from 
Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas  This process covers the metals tin, 
tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TGs), as well as cobalt, and from 2023 mica  
As there are often several tiers of suppliers between Ericsson and smelters or 
refineries, the Company does not normally have a direct purchasing relation-
ship with these  More information on this topic can be found in Ericsson’s 
annual Conflict Minerals report, available on the Company’s website

The telecommunications sector in which Ericsson operates is highly regulated 
and increasingly politicized  National and transnational sector-specific policies 
affect the behavior and investment decision of service providers, which, in turn 
has implications on the services offered to consumers  Consequently, Ericsson’s 
policy and advocacy activities can have an indirect impact on people’s access 
to connectivity and the affordability of those services 
Ericsson’s market is highly regulated, and its evolving technology is increas-
ingly on the agenda of developing geopolitical alliances  The prominence of 
global open standards has enabled economies of scale, making mobile connec-
tivity the fastest-ever scaling technology solution globally  Policy, regulation 
and new geopolitical alliances can significantly impact Ericsson’s addressable 
market and have an influence on its supply chain and research and develop-
ment clusters  At the same time, engaging policymakers, either directly or via 
intermediary organizations, to influence policy outcomes must be conducted in 
a manner that enhances Ericsson’s reputation and mitigates corruption risks  
Ericsson’s Group Policy on Government and Policy Advocacy (GPA) states that, 
Ericsson needs to anticipate, analyze, manage and mitigate political, regula-
tory, reputational and sensitive technology risks, drawing from several param-
eters to so support its business objectives  It further articulates the Company’s 
commitment to conducting government and policy advocacy with transpar-
ency, integrity and ethics  A more detailed Group Directive on Policy Advocacy 
and Interaction sets forth the binding requirements applicable to managing 
advocacy activities with public officials and industry representatives  These 
rules of engagement are mandatory for all GPA advocacy activities 
Ericsson is a member of national and transnational trade associations relevant 
to its business and also participates in organizations with a more general 
industrial and business focus  Ericsson only participates in intermediary organi-
zations that are aligned with the Company’s values and uses its position to try 
and maintain consistency on policy positions as they are developed

During 2023, Ericsson undertook a materiality assessment to update its under-
standing of its material sustainability-related impacts, risks and opportunities  
The scope of the assessment was the operations of the Ericsson Group and 
its upstream and downstream value chain, with a focus on the electronics 
manufacturing supply chain when analyzing upstream impacts  The geograph-
ical scope of the assessment was global, but with a focus on the countries and 
regions in which the company has a significant number of employees, suppliers 
and customers, also factoring in the Company’s presence in geographies with 
known heightened risks of human rights violations and substandard working 
The assessment was carried out in the following main phases:
A  Definition of the universe of environment, social and governance (ESG) 
B  Initial assessment of impacts, risks and opportunities
C  Validation with key internal stakeholders and subject matter experts
E  Review and approval by the Executive Team and Audit and Compliance 
A  The universe of ESG matters assessed was based on matters found in ESG 
reporting frameworks, supplemented by input from benchmarking of mat-
ters included in industry peers' and customers’ external ESG disclosures, 
as well as matters covered in the assessment methodologies of a select 
B  After scoping out matters with no apparent relation to Ericsson and its value 
chain, remaining matters were analyzed in more detail to identify actual 
and potential negative and positive impacts, as well as actual and potential 
Ericsson’s current understanding of impacts, risks and opportunities, 
based on the Company’s peer-reviewed research into the environmental 
impacts of its products and solutions, existing human rights due diligence 
processes, risk management framework, as well as ongoing stakeholder 
engagements, were incorporated in this phase of the assessment  Additional 
sources of information used included, but were not limited to, external scien-
tific research, industry and non-governmental organization reports, third-
party ESG risk intelligence tools, results of employee surveys, conducted 
supplier audits, internal risk assessments and information about cases 
Negative impacts were assessed based on their severity (scale, scope 
and irremediable character) and positive impacts were assessed based on 
their scale and scope  For potential impacts, the likelihood of the impact

value chain, in relation to customers and end-users, impacts with a con-
nection to Ericsson’s portfolio were considered  Impacts occurring within 
customers’ operations or value chains but with no or minimal connection to 
Ericsson’s products, solutions or technology were not considered relevant 
While numerical scales were used to quantify scale, scope and irremedi-
ability in the initial stages of the assessment of all impacts, the thresholds 
applied for ultimately determining if a matter should be considered material 
or not were largely qualitative and involved varying degrees of subjective

and business representatives to both validate the assessment of material-
ity, as well as to embed understanding of impacts, risks and opportunities 
D  Subsequently, a not-for-profit organization with expertise in the area of 
human rights was consulted for a review of identified impacts related to 
human and labor rights  This review was intended to function as external

Team and the Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors  
The results of the materiality assessment are presented below  The table 
shows where material impacts occur, or may occur, in the value chain and not 
where actions to manage impacts take place, which in most cases would be by 
Ericsson through its own operations  While the assessment scope included risks 
and opportunities, these will need to be further analyzed and incorporated into 
other business processes to ensure consistent treatment with other risk factors 
and to enable a more refined analysis of potential financial implications, going

Changes in material matters compared with previous reporting periods
The 2023 materiality assessment was done on a more granular level compared 
with previous assessments, meaning several of the matters presented below 
were previously part of broader topics assessed  This does not mean that their 
inherent significance has changed, only how they are presented in the list of 
material topics  Matters which were previously not considered material, or 
which were not included in previous assessments, but which are now included 
due to the full value chain being considered include: water resources, air pollu-
tion, adequate housing, security of people, technology ethics, supplier relation-

O2  Reporting principles, scope and external assurance
This Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report ("the report", "this 
report"), published on March 6, 2024, constitutes Ericsson’s annual statutory 
sustainability report and contains information about material environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) related impacts, risks and opportunities, as well 
as governance and policies, management approaches, metrics and targets 
relevant to these matters  A description of Ericsson’s strategy and business 
model can be found on pages 7-12, and a description of financial and non-
financial risk factors on pages 105-119 of the Financial Report, which is also 
The report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) standards  Ericsson has, in the preparation of the report, 
applied reporting principles as prescribed in the standard GRI 1: Foundation 
(2021)  The report has also been prepared in accordance with the UN Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights reporting framework  
The report also includes climate-related disclosures included in the rec-
ommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) as well as relevant disclosures in applicable Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB) standards  Ericsson is also reporting on the core 
disclosures of the Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics developed and endorsed 
by the International Business Council and the World Economic Forum  As a 
supplement to the report, an ESG reporting reference index is published on the 
ESG section of the Investor Relations pages on Ericsson’s website  The index 
contains detailed references to applied reporting frameworks and standards 
Unless otherwise stated, the information and data provided pertain to the 
period January 1 to December 31  The report covers the Ericsson Group, which 
is the parent company Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson and its subsidiaries 
as presented in note P8 to the parent company’s financial statements in the 
Financial Report  The report does not include environmental and social data 
related to associated companies or joint ventures  These constitute a limited 
In 2022, Ericsson acquired Vonage, now part of Business Area Global 
Communications Platform, and in 2020, Cradlepoint, now part of Business 
Area Enterprise Wireless Solutions  For a limited number of ESG disclosures, 
primarily people-related, these companies have not yet been fully consolidated 
into this report  At year-end 2023, these companies had a combined headcount 
of about 4,200 employees, equal to 4,2% of the Group’s total employee 
headcount  Where the scope of a disclosure excludes one or both of these 
As a general principle, baselines for Group ESG targets are recalculated 
when the effect of a merger, acquisition or divestment on the performance of 
a target key performance indicator is assessed as significant  In other cases, 
baselines or data pertaining to previous reporting periods are not restated  
Information on restatements made in the reporting year can be found in note 
The report contains disclosures related to the Company’s upstream and 
downstream value chain including suppliers, vendors, customers and other 
business partners  There are inherent uncertainties to the completeness, 
accuracy and verifiability of this information, as it relates to performance and 
activities that are beyond the Company’s direct influence and control 
The report has been subject to assurance procedures by the Company’s statu-
tory auditors in accordance with the assurance standard ISAE 3000  The report 
as a whole has been subject to limited assurance procedures  Additionally, 
information on GHG emissions in Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 categories Business 
travel and Downstream transportation, presented in note E1, as well as infor-
mation on the share of women per employee category, presented in note S1, 
have been subject to reasonable assurance procedures  The assurance report 
Ericsson publishes other ESG-related statements and reports on its website, 
such as the annual CDP Climate Change questionnaire response, a Modern 
Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement, and a Conflict Minerals Report 
Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility report 2023
The following information in the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility 
Report has been restated: – Information in note E1 about purchased non-renewable electricity has been 
restated for the years 2022 and 2021 to align with emerging disclosure 
regulation  The total amount of purchased non-renewable electricity has 
not been restated but is from 2023 presented with a breakdown on electric-
ity from fossil sources and electricity from nuclear sources which was not 
included in previous years  – Information in note E1 about Scope 3 GHG emissions for the years 2022 
and 2021 has been restated  In the process to validate Ericsson’s emis-
sion reduction targets by the SBTi, emissions in the categories Upstream 
transportation, Downstream transportation, and Fuel- and energy-related 
activities were reclassified within the same three categories to align with the 
SBTi methodology, including a change in the application of well-to-wheel 
and tank-to-wheel emission factors  In short, this has meant an increase of 
emissions reported in the category Upstream transportation, and a decrease 
in emissions reported  in the categories  Downstream transportation and 
Fuel- and energy-related activities, compared to what was reported in 
previous years  In addition, emissions in the category  Use of sold products 
and services for the year 2022 have been restated due the correction of 
an identified calculation error  The resulting changes are presented below  
Consequently, total GHG emissions, the share of the value chain carbon 
footprint and emissions intensity broken down per scope for the years 2022 
and 2021 reported in note E1 have also been restated  
N/A – Information in note E2 about other emissions to air has been restated for the 
years 2022 and 2021, as Ericsson has redefined the scope of this disclosure  
The new scope is aligned to the boundaries of direct Scope 1 emissions as 
set forth by the GHG Protocol  Previously, the scope included indirect sources 
of emissions, including purchased energy at facilities, business travel, com-
muting and transport  The resulting changes are presented below  
77 – Information in note E4 about waste generated in operations broken down 
by disposal method has been restated for the years 2022 and 2021 to align 
with emerging disclosure regulation  The total amount of waste generated 
has not been restated but the breakdown per recovery and disposal method 
is now presented with more granularity compared to previous years  – Information in note S1 about employees, new hires and turnover broken 
down by age groups has been restated for the years 2022 and 2021 to align 
with emerging disclosure regulation  Prior to 2023, the age brackets used 
were: under 25, 25-35, 36-45, 46-55 and over 55 years old  As of 2023, the 
brackets used are: under 30, 30-50 and over 50 years old  – Information in note S1 about the CEO to employee pay ratio for the years 
2022 and 2021 has been restated to align with emerging disclosure regula-
tion  Prior to 2023 the mean employee salary and mean total compensation 
was used to calculate this metric  As of 2023, the median employee salary 
and median total compensation is used to calculate this metric  – Information in note S2 about fatality and lost-time incident rates has been 
restated for the years 2022 and 2021 to align with emerging disclosure regu-
lation  Prior to 2023 these rates were calculated using the assumed number 
of hours worked by 100 FTEs in a year (200,000) as the normalization factor  
As of 2023 the normalization factor is the assumed number of hours worked 
by 500 FTEs which is 1,000,000 hours  – Information in note G3 about the number of smelters, their RMAP participa-
tion and RMAP conformity status has been restated for the year 2022 to 
align with information presented in Ericsson’s Conflict Minerals Report filed 
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission  In previous years the 
information presented in the Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility 
Report reflected a snapshot of information available at the reporting year 
cut-off date, meaning the period covered was not the same as the period

Auditor’s Assurance Report on Ericsson’s Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Report and statement regarding 
To Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson, corporate identity number 
We have been engaged by the Board of Directors and Executive 
Management of Telefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson (“Ericsson”) to 
undertake an assurance engagement of the Ericsson Sustainability and 
Corporate Responsibility Report (“the Sustainability Report”) for the 
year 2023  The Company has defined the scope of the Sustainability 
Report on page 48 in the Sustainability Report, which also constitutes 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management
The Board of Directors and the Executive Management are responsible 
for the preparation of the Sustainability Report including the Statutory 
Sustainability Report in accordance with the applicable criteria and the 
Annual Accounts Act respectively  The criteria are defined on page 48 in 
the Sustainability Report, and are part of the Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines published by GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), which are 
applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and 
calculation principles that the Company has developed  This responsi-
bility also includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a 
Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether 
due to fraud or error  Responsibilities of the auditor 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report 
based on the assurance procedures we have performed and to express 
an opinion regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report  Our engage-
ment is limited to historical information presented and does therefore 
We conducted our assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 
3000 (revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews 
of Historical Financial Information  The engagement includes limited 
assurance on the complete Sustainability Report, and an audit of 
selected information consisting of GHG emissions in Scope 1, 2, and 
Scope 3 categories Business travel and Downstream transportation 
disclosed on page 15, as well as information on the share of women per 
employee category, disclosed on page 26 in the Sustainability Report  
The objective of an audit is to obtain reasonable assurance that the 
information is free of material misstatements  A reasonable assurance 
engagement includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the selected information in the Sustainability Report  A limited assur-
ance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and apply-
ing analytical and other limited assurance procedures  Our examination 
regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report has been conducted in 
accordance with FAR’s accounting standard RevR 12 The auditor’s 
opinion regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report  A limited assur-
ance engagement and an examination according to RevR 12 is different 
and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden 
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, 
which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of 
quality management including policies or procedures regarding compli-
ance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements  We are independent of Ericsson in 
accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and 
have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
The limited assurance procedures performed and the examination 
according to RevR 12 do not enable us to obtain assurance that we 
would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified 
in an audit  The conclusion based on a limited assurance engagement 
and an examination according to RevR 12 does not provide the same 
level of assurance as a conclusion based on an audit  Since this engage-
ment is combined, our conclusions regarding the limited assurance, the 
reasonable assurance, and the examination according to RevR 12 will 
Our procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of 
Directors and the Executive Management as described above  We 
consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below 
Based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the 
Sustainability Report, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accord-
ance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive 
In our opinion, the selected information in the Sustainability Report 
which has been subject to our reasonable assurance procedures has, 
in all material respects, been prepared in accordance with the criteria 
defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Management
