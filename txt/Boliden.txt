About Boliden’s Annual and Sustainability Report
The Annual and Sustainability Report describes Boliden’s financial 
performance and sustainability work  The Directors’ Report 
comprises pages 8–11, 14–15, 18–24, 26–27, 30–47, 53–57, and 
66–77  Boliden’s Sustainability Report as required by Chapter 6, 
section 11 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, is presented on 
pages 8–11, 14–15, 22, 26–27, 30–41, 53–57, 71–72 and 122–127  
For generations 
to come
Boliden contributes to a sustainable future by 
extracting, producing and recycling metals 
that are essential for the development of 
society  By caring for people, the environment 
and society, and by using our extensive 
experience, high-level skills and leading 
technology, we can offer highly competitive 
metals with low climate impact 
Key figures
Our core business: base metals 
Throughout history, metals have contributed 
to mankind’s progress in matters large and 
small  Demand for the base metals we produce 
is expected to be higher than ever as the 
climate transition progresses  Boliden is ready 
to provide them in the most sustainable way 
possible 
COPPER
Thanks to its excellent ability to conduct electricity, more 
than 60 percent of the copper produced in the world is 
used to generate or conduct electricity, for example in 
electric vehicles  
NICKEL
More than two thirds of the world’s nickel production is 
used in making stainless steel  Nickel is also an important 
component in modern battery technologies  
ZINC
Steel is galvanized with the help of zinc to protect the 
material, which ­
increases resistance to harsh weather 
conditions  Therefore, zinc is used in for example wind 
turbines and vehicle chassis 
LEAD
The fully recyclable metal lead has long been essential for 
storing energy in everything from vehicle ­
batteries to the 
backup batteries used in healthcare

What is your experience of 2023?
“I do not think one should hide the fact that we have expe-
rienced a year that has been challenging in several ways  
After a strong beginning, the prices of many base metals fell 
from February onwards, due to economic slowdown in large 
parts of the world, while Covid-19 recovery in China was 
weaker than expected  This has affected our revenues for 
the year, mainly within Business Area Mines  In addition, we 
faced operational challenges in our own businesses ”
Which events are especially important to highlight?
“A very important parameter for heavy industries in general 
is that the major investments carried out follow the time 
schedule and budget  For us, 2023 was a year of historically 
large investments and we have of course dedicated a lot 
of energy to the investments at Aitik, the Boliden Area and 
Odda  These three projects are proceeding according to our 
plans and will be largely completed by 2024–2025  By then, 
zinc production in Odda – with world leading technology 
and sustainability performance – will have almost doubled  
Aitik’s tailings pond will have a reinforced dam structure, 
enabling future deposition, while production in the Boliden 
Area will be more climate-friendly  On top of this, it should 
be highlighted that we during the year inaugurated the new 
port infrastructure for Harjavalta, enabling us to handle 
concentrate input much more efficiently  
Turning to the challenges we have faced, I would like to 
emphasize the fire at the Rönnskär smelter and the decision 
to place the operation at our Irish Tara mine under care and 
maintenance  For both of these very difficult incidents, we 
have effectively taken action to minimize the consequences 
and at Rönnskär, we are especially grateful to have avoided 
physical harm to our co-workers  In both cases, we work 
on restarting operations, at Rönnskär through a feasibil-
ity study for a new tank house and at Tara by identifying 
conditions for a restart in 2024 with long-term sustainable 
production ” 
What is your view on the development of operations 
during the year?
“Our strategy is to continuously develop productivity, while 
in parallel identifying investments that strengthen our 
competitiveness and take us towards our vision of being the 
most climate-friendly and respected metal provider in the 
world  At the start of the year, we were able to communi-
cate good exploration results from the Garpenberg mine, 
which in turn made the foundation for conceptual studies 
on how to expand production  In Aitik, we have piloted

autonomous mine trucks and within Business Area Smelters 
we have increased our offering of metals with a low-carbon 
footprint  
Towards the end of the year, our climate targets were vali-
dated and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, 
making Boliden one of very few companies globally within 
our sector to be given this recognition  I consider this an 
important proof of us being at the forefront of developing 
a long-term responsible mining and metals industry  These 
are just a few examples of how we continue to develop 
our competitiveness with the metal markets of tomorrow 
in mind  By clear delegation of responsibility within the 
organization, similar work is taking place at all our units 
and in the same way we are making significant efforts to 
strengthen our common safety culture  In this area too, the 
performance has been good, with the lowest Loss Time 
Injury frequency ever ” 
What focus areas lie ahead for Boliden?
“Our assessment is that the current content of our metal 
portfolio is beneficial in the long term  Many of the metals, 
such as copper and nickel, will be demanded in much larger 
quantities for the expansion of energy infrastructure and 
the implementation of fossil fuel-free technologies within 
several areas  We will therefore continue to invest in explo-
ration, both adjacent to our current mining units and in new 
geographies  One example of a project in a new geography 
is Laver, where our ambition is to submit a renewed applica-
tion for mining concession during autumn 2024  In addition, 
we will continue to develop operations at our existing sites 
within both our business areas through projects that can 
contribute to higher productivity and strengthened com-
petitiveness  One should keep in mind that also 2024 is a 
year of large investments, so naturally we will have a signif-
icant focus on, among other things, that the ramping up of 
production levels at Odda will proceed according to plan  
Boliden turns 100 years in 2024  This will of course be 
celebrated and serves as a reminder that long-term value is 
created from actual conditions and that execution of small, 
continuous improvements often are equally important 
as large, one-of-a-kind projects  Last but maybe most 
important of all, I look forward to, just like this year, together 
with all my talented and ambitious colleagues, continuing 
to drive and develop our business and workplaces  It is 
through our decentralized corporate culture combined with 
skilled and responsible co-workers that we will shape the 
success of tomorrow and continue our evolution towards a 
global role model within our industry ”

Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
| The world at large
Boliden and beyond
Societal development has long relied on metals due 
to their durability and ability to conduct electricity and 
heat  As an enabler of the climate transition, demand 
is increasing and securing future metal supply is 
becoming a topic of strategic importance for Europe 
Everyday life
Metals and minerals are important for almost every aspect 
of our daily lives  They play a vital role in everything from
agriculture, healthcare, communications, water and energy 
supply, transport and space technology to the construction
of our cities  Without metals, our modern lives would simply 
not be possible 
Climate transition
Boliden produces many of the metals that are critical for the 
climate transition  Copper is necessary for generation,
transmission and storage of energy, and thus needed for 
electricity grids and electrical and electronic equipment  
Zinc is used to galvanize steel, which protects against 
corrosion and thereby, for example, extends the lifespan of 
offshore windfarms that are exposed to harsh conditions  
Up to 40 kilograms of nickel can be needed for the battery 
of a single electric car, while it also uses smaller lead-based 
batteries for auxiliary purposes  
Circular economy
Metal circularity is an increasingly important aspect for 
companies and consumers as they make decisions based 
on total life cycle costs  Boliden recycles large volumes of 
copper, zinc and lead from electronics, steel mill dust and 
batteries  Recycled metal is growing in importance to the 
overall supply, but is not sufficient to meet demand and 
metals in many applications will not become available for 
recycling for decades  For example, power lines may have a 
lifespan of more than 40 years 
Sustainable operations
Fossil fuels typically play a large direct role in metal pro-
duction and are in many countries also used indirectly to 
generate electricity needed  Other challenges facing the 
industry include the management of waste, access to water, 
reclamation of old operational sites as well as human rights  
Europe is often a forerunner in dealing with these issues 
through more stringent permit requirements for mining and 
metal industries  
Boliden strives to be the industry benchmark in all matters 
related to sustainability and acceptance from authorities, 
local communities and other stakeholders is vital to gain the 
required permits to continue operations  In global terms, we 
have among the lowest carbon footprints through innovative 
solutions and good access to fossil fuel-free energy  Read 
more about our sustainability management on pages 14–15  
Important part of the economy
Around the world, the mining industry is an important 
source of job opportunities both directly and indirectly 
through its investments and purchase of goods and ser-
vices  In Sweden, an estimated 7,400 people are employed 
directly by metal mining companies and 750 people in 
industrial mineral companies  A job in the mining industry 
creates 1 8 indirect jobs at the subcontractor level  This in 
turn creates further job opportunities in supermarkets, 
restaurants, culture and public services – all in all contribut-
ing to vibrant communities  
Metal production is also a major source of tax revenue for 
both the state and the sparsely populated areas where such 
companies operate  In some countries, mining companies 
account for more than 20 percent of total tax revenue  In
2023, Boliden paid SEK 1,763 million (2,815) in corporate tax 
in its operating countries, excluding social security contribu-
tions, excise duties and property taxes  
Metal availability
In light of the above, demand for metals is expected to 
increase with urbanization, prosperity and climate-friendly 
technologies  For the base metals that Boliden produces, 
Wood McKenzie estimates demand increases of 75 percent 
for copper, 48 percent for zinc, 74 percent for lead and 94 
percent for nickel between 2023–2050  
Access to metal is thus essential to societal progress and 
over-reliance on individual countries for supply has become 
a strategic risk  Accordingly, the European Commission in 
2023 defined updated lists of critical and strategic metals 
– including for example copper and nickel – with specific 
requirements for both European production and reliance on 
individual countries for supply

Transportation
Our metals are crucial for the 
future of the transport sector  
For example, a typical EV 
contains 30-40 kg nickel and 
80 kg copper  Galvanized steel 
is used by the automotive 
industry to prevent vehicles 
from rusting 
Healthcare
There are many applications 
in the healthcare sector for 
Boliden metals  Copper has 
outstanding antiviral and 
antibacterial properties, which 
makes it an ideal material for 
surfaces that are constantly 
touched  Zinc is used in 
healing ointments, nickel in 
surgical instruments and lead 
in x-ray protective equipment 
and hospital backup batteries 
Infrastructure
Galvanizing steel using zinc 
prevents corrosion and 
thereby extends the lifespan 
of anything exposed to 
weather from buildings and 
infrastructure, to offshore 
windfarms 
Energy production
More than 60 percent of 
global copper production is 
used to generate or conduct 
electricity  Copper is found 
in major electrical renewable 
energy components, such 
as turbines, generators, 
transformers, inverters and 
electrical cables 
Recycling
All of Boliden’s base metals 
are recyclable  Our Rönnskär

Boliden as a sustainable investment
A stable and sustainable value chain
Our excellent technical know-how combined with good 
access to fossil fuel-free electricity together make for 
manufacturing processes with world-class productivity and 
environmental performance  Regardless, Boliden has set 
the target of reducing absolute carbon dioxide emissions by 
42 percent by 2030, with 2021 as the base year  We extract 
metals from both ore concentrates and secondary materi-
als and take responsibility for the entire supply chain  The 
sustainability-focused partnerships we build with customers 
form an important local value chain in northern Europe  
Boliden is a leader in the development of methods for the 
reclamation of closed mines and the disposal of hazardous 
waste  We are working with the development of proactive 
risk management and increased involvement in occupational 
health and safety issues to improve safety for employees 
and contractors alike  Boliden is an active member of the 
leading industry organizations whose aim is to improve 
occupational health and safety in the mining and smelting 
industries 
A competitive product portfolio
Boliden provides the metals needed to improve society for 
future generations  The main metals are copper, zinc, nickel 
and lead, which are all important for a sustainable society  
Copper and nickel are crucial for increased electrification  
Lead is used in the storage of electricity, and zinc is neces-
sary for improving corrosion protection, thereby reducing 
resource utilization  Boliden’s by-products include gold, 
silver, platinum and palladium  Gold is of great importance 
for the stability of global financial markets, while platinum 
and palladium are important for emission control  
All in all, our multi-faceted product portfolio makes us well-
equipped for the opportunities and challenges we face in 
the metal markets of today and tomorrow 
The right expertise and financial position
Boliden has both the expertise and financial position to 
develop mining and smelting operations  
Our employees carry a valuable cultural heritage of almost a 
century of experience from mining and smelting operations  
The value chain from mines to smelters creates synergies 
between the business areas and increases stability in the 
Group’s earnings potential  This stability is reinforced by 
the tendency of treatment charges to move in the opposite 
direction to variable base metal prices  Over time, precious 
metal prices also tend to have a negative correlation to 
those of base metals, and this increases the stability of the 
Group’s earnings potential  Production takes place in north-
ern Europe, where political risk is low  Project management 
is run in-house with a focus on safety, production stability 
and technological development  
Boliden strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet and has 
defined financial targets that are adapted to prepare for 
market fluctuations, value-creating investments 
and competitive dividends to shareholders  
Boliden’s most important mines have long lifespans and 
the focus lies on mine-site exploration where the economic 
potential is the greatest  Acquisitions are made selectively, if 
and when the right opportunity arises 
With the right expertise and financial 
position to develop mining and smelting 
operations, a sustainable value chain and 
a competitive product portfolio, 
we provide Europe with the metals 
needed for the societal climate transition

Anders Forsgren 
Social Sustainability Manager Boliden Mines
What are the specific features of the Sarkanenä 
Sustainability Park at Boliden Aitik?
“The ecological compensation in Sarkanenä park is the 
result of a collaboration between Boliden, the Swedish 
University of Agricultural Sciences and the land owner 
Sveaskog  The forest here is old but has thus far lacked the 
characteristics of ancient woodland  The re-creation of 
structures typical for ancient woodland has been prioritized 
in our reclamation work at the site ” 
What is the main purpose of our Sustainability Parks?
“The Sustainability Parks form a part of our ambition to, in 
return for what we have borrowed, give something back to 
both society and nature  They highlight the sites’ history 
and biodiversity, and our presence today, yesterday and 
tomorrow  We invite the public to experience how we work 
with ecological reclamation and compensation but also with 
other sustainability aspects like climate and traditional Sami 
land use ”
Are there any other parks in the pipeline and what characteristics will they have?
“All of Boliden’s Sustainability Parks will be unique as they 
are created in harmony with the natural characteristics of 
the site  However, there are some commonalities: all parks 
will have a shelter, information signs in multiple languages 
and signs specially designed to address the curiosity of 
children  There will always be a focus on biodiversity and on 
informing the public about this  The guiding words for the 
creation of the parks are responsible, playful, innovative and 
accessible and these should be reflected in the experience 
of park visitors  As for other parks in the pipeline, there are 
many sites we envision for future parks and our ambition is 
to open a new park annually in the years ahead ” 
Near Aitik, we have inaugurated our first Sustainability 
Park – a place where locals and tourists can enjoy, and learn 
about, the beautiful nature and rich biodiversity around our 
mine  Anders Forsgren, Social Sustainability Manager at 
Boliden Mines, shares the details

The carbon dioxide emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 were 842 
ktonnes (915), a 16 percent decrease from our 2021 base 
year level of 999 ktonnes  For 2023, the main decrease 
derives from lower emissions from Scope 2 where the 
electricity grid mix has improved  This shows that we are 
in line with our 2030 target  During the year, the target 
was approved and validated by the Science Based Targets 
initiative  See pages 30–31 for more information

The sick leave rate shall remain below 4 0 percent 
< 
4 
%
The accident rate was 4 4 (4 7) for Boliden’s employ-
ees and contractors, which represented a reduction 
compared to the previous year  In occupational health 
& safety, we focus on proactive measures and greater 
involvement on the part of management, employees and 
contractors in day-to-day safety work, which is expected 
to contribute to improved safety and lead to fewer 
accidents 
The sick leave rate for the year was 5 5 percent (5 6) with 
seasonal variations  Sick leave remains at an elevated 
level after the Covid-19 pandemic  This is believed to be 
partly the result of a change in behavior due to the advice 
from authorities, with more employees choosing to stay 
home when experiencing cold symptoms and seasonal 
influenza 
Increasing the share of women is an important part of 
Boliden’s diversity efforts in the historically male-domi-
nated metals and mining sector  During the year, 30 percent 
of new permanent hires were women  The female share 
of total average FTEs (affected by employees temporarily 
furloughed as the Tara mine was placed under care and 
maintenance from july onwards) was 22 5 percent (20 8) 
The intensity of metals to air emissions increased to 29 
(23)  Underlying reasons for this were the tank house fire 
and an unusually high number of production stops at 
Rönnskär  Boliden has relatively low metals-to-air emis-
sions and works continuously at lowering them further 
The intensity of metals to water emissions increased to 
63 8 (47 8)  Underlying reasons for this were challenges 
with the water treatment systems at our Odda and 
Rönnskär smelters  This is being addressed by, for 
example, the construction of a new water treatment plant 
at Odda  However, Boliden has in general low met-
als-to-water emissions and works continuously to reduce 
them further  
No significant environmental incidents occurred during 
the year, which is in line with Boliden’s ­
targets  We work 
systematically to control and manage environmental

| Income model
Boliden operates on the metal market’s two submarkets where raw 
materials are sold from mines to smelters, and where metals are 
sold mainly to industrial customers  Boliden’s integrated business 
model entails certain synergies and provides stable income for 
the Group, as mines and smelters often have different cycles for 
revenue generation

Boliden’s Business Area Mines produces metal concentrates
Revenues are affected by ore tonnage, metal grades, 
recovery during the concentration process, inventory 
changes, the price of concentrates in USD, and exchange 
rate fluctuations  
Gross profit and revenues usually have the same value, as 
Mines has no input raw materials  Revenues from metal 
concentrates are based on the London Metal Exchange 
(LME) price for each respective metal less treatment and 
refining charges (TC and RC) and impurities in concentrates, 
and calculated on the payable metal content (the propor-
tion of metal in concentrate for which the mines can charge)  
The levels of TC/ RC and impurity charges are determined 
in annual negotiations between leading mines and smelters 
and become the benchmark for other players  The levels are 
governed by the global supply of concentrates from mines 
and the demand from smelters  
Operating profit is gross profit less operating costs, mainly 
personnel, consumables, spare parts, external services, 
energy and depreciation 
An individual mine has natural variations in grades, waste 
rock dilution, energy requirements at different depths, 
equipment maintenance and other factors that result in the 
profit varying over time  These variations are often known 
in advance and are clearly defined in life-of-mine plans  
Boliden guides on major changes in grades in the larger 
mines when grades are expected to significantly deviate 
from the average reserves grades 
Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023

Introduction
Smelters
Boliden’s Business Area Smelters ­
produces refined 
metals and by-products 
Revenue from metals is based on the LME price of the 
metal with the addition of premiums, the level of which is 
determined by the local balance between metal demand, 
smelting capacity and payment terms  The premium also 
covers costs for transportation and customized alloys  
Gross profit is the difference between revenues and 
the price of the raw materials, and consists of treatment 
and refining charges (from concentrates and secondary 
raw materials), penalties (remuneration for impurities), 
metal premiums, income from free metals, and income 
from the sale of by-products  Free metals arise when the 
amount of metal recovered exceeds the payable metal 
content of purchased metal concentrates and secondary 
materials, while by-products such as sulphuric acid are 
extracted in the processes  The content of payable metal 
in raw materials and income from sales are hedged 
Operating profit is gross profit less operating costs, the 
most important of which are personnel, consumables, 
spare parts, external services, energy and depreciation  
Unlike Mines, Smelters has a similar production situation 
over time with the exception of annual maintenance 
shutdowns, which are usually scheduled during the 
warm season  The scope varies from year to year, as 
more extensive maintenance is usually carried out every 
two years  Boliden provides guidance on the date and 
financial impact of maintenance shutdowns for the year 
ahead

Implementation of CSRD
Starting from our Annual- and sustainability report for FY2024, 
Boliden will report on sustainability according to the new Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) from the EU, as transposed 
into Swedish legislation  The reporting will cover environmental, 
social and governance aspects related to Boliden’s operations and 
value chain, based on the requirements in the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS)  The aim of CSRD and ESRS is to provide 
reliable and comparable sustainability data to impacted stakeholders 
and users of sustainability information  In the coming years, sec-
tor-specific standards will also be introduced 
Boliden is currently implementing the new reporting standards across 
the organization  The work is led by topical experts within the different 
areas and coordinated by the Climate & Sustainability Control function 
at Group  A first double materiality assessment was conducted 
during 2023, which sets the scope for our ESRS reporting  Short-term, 
Boliden is focusing on ensuring compliance with the new reporting 
requirements  Long-term, the more comprehensive and comparable 
sustainability reporting can support Boliden’s aim to become the most 
climate friendly metal provider in the world

Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
| Strategic focus
Governance model
We strive for a work culture based on employee participa-
tion and involvement with responsibility and decision-mak-
ing as close to the areas concerned as possible  We want to 
ensure that our 10 general managers, and all line managers, 
feel fully responsible and fully empowered to run their busi-
nesses  Financial planning is conservative to manage market 
volatility and the strength of the balance sheet is adjusted 
to be prepared for both weak markets and opportunities 
for acquisitions and investments, while financial targets and 
dividend policy are set to reflect the desired risk level 
Sustainable operations that generate value
Boliden’s focus on responsible and sustainable operations of 
high international standard has been the foundation for the 
company for a long time  Competences have been devel-
oped to be competitive in the transformation of the industry 
as it meets more stringent demands on sustainability and 
reduced environmental footprint and climate impact  Today, 
Boliden can be considered the industry benchmark due to 
our world-class productivity and a climate impact that is 
significantly lower than others in the industry 
Reduced emissions
CO2 emissions is a strategic area where Boliden has the 
ambitious target of reducing absolute carbon dioxide 
emissions by 42 percent by 2030, with 2021 as the base year  
The roadmap to meet the 2030 targets has been incorpo-
rated into the long-term financial plan, fully accounting for 
the required investments and other commercial deci-
sions  Moreover, Boliden has committed to science-based 
targets, which creates value by improving our risk profile, 
strengthening the possibility for social and legal license to 
operate, improving access to different sources of capital 
and strengthening the ability to attract and retain talent in 
the future  
Improved safety
A safe and healthy workplace is a fundamental prerequisite 
for running a successful company characterized by care for 
people, high productivity, and profitability  Development 
of a strong safety culture has been ongoing for many years 
in Boliden and statistically, our employees are now safer 
at work than in their spare time  By focusing on proactive 
measures, exchange of experience and learning from others 
as well as greater involvement on the part of management, 
employees, and contractors in day-to-day safety work, we 
have been successful in reducing the number of accidents 
Value generation
Boliden has a history of profitable mining with low grade 
ores and has developed technical skills in mines and 
smelters that generate good profitability despite a high 
cost structure in the operating countries  The strategy is 
centred around continuous improvements and a focus on 
operational efficiency, which contribute to value generation 
without the need for major investments  Strong and com-
petitive operating units form the basis for organic growth  
Expansion of existing operations is normally less capital 
intensive and associated with less risk than new projects or 
acquisitions  To supplement organic growth, we evaluate 
different opportunities for acquisitions and collaborations 
for exploration according to strict investment criteria  
Strategy for sustainable 
operations
Base metals are needed for Europe’s transition towards climate-friendly 
societies  Demand is not only driven by increasing prosperity and 
urbanization, but also by electrification, energy storage and for more 
stringent product lifespan and recyclability requirements  As a provider 
of these metals, Boliden’s sustainable production processes within mining 
and smelting are essential to remain competitive, and our strategy aims to 
secure a strong position in the markets of today and tomorrow

Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
| How we create metals
Our metal production
Our value chain begins in exploration and through our mines, 
concentrators and smelters, we create the metals that enable 
the climate transition  To a large extent, our success depends on 
the surroundings of our operations, with local stakeholders such 
as indigenous people and neighboring communities, as well as 
other factors like energy supply having an impact 
Exploration 
We need mineral deposits in order to run our mining opera-
tions  Exploration is about finding, prioritizing, investigating 
and analyzing these in order to examine the conditions for 
potential mining operations  Aerial surveying, outcrop-
pings, geophysical and seismic methods are used initially, 
while diamond core drilling is the final stage of the process  
It can take 5–20 years from the initial explorations to the 
start of mining, but by primarily exploring in the vicinity of 
our mines, we can shorten lead times  At the same time, 
we invest in field exploration in entirely new areas and also 
acquire projects from other companies  All in all, this creates 
a long-term perspective in our exploration work, which 
helps safeguard metal supply for a long time to come 
Open pits and underground mines 
Boliden extracts metals both in tunnel systems as deep 
as 1,600 meters below the surface and in open pit mines 
with surface areas greater than 50 football pitches  Using 
innovative processes such as automation and geoposition-
ing, we can boast world-class productivity  Solutions such as 
energy conserving heat exchangers in underground mines, 
an ambitious electrification strategy, good access to water 
and fossil fuel-free electricity enable us to extract ore with 
comparatively low climate and environmental impact  And 
when the ore eventually runs out, we make sure the land we 
use is restored in the best way possible through continuous 
reclamation activities, currently covering about 30 active 
and closed mining sites  
Electrifying underground mining
During the year, we conducted trials with electric 
loaders and trucks in the Boliden Area’s Rävliden 
deposit – a major milestone on the road to making 
it the world’s first fossil fuel-free underground 
mining operation by 2025  Read more about our 
climate targets on pages 30–31 
Self-driving trucks
During the year, Aitik conducted a pilot 
project for self-driving mining trucks  The 
Autonomous Haulage System is planned 
for integration in regular operations in 
2025  Read more on page 23 
Tailings management
Safety around our tailings ponds and 
their dam facilities is a high priority area 
for Boliden  Read more on page 36 
Respect for indigenous peoples
In a cooperation project with the Mausjaur Sami 
community aimed at finding ways to operate 
side-by-side, we, for example, partially financed 
a new rarking facility  Read more about our 
co-existence with indigenous people on pages 
40–41 
Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023

Operations
Concentrator 
The mills at our concentrators grind crushed ore into a 
porous state before it is passed on for flotation, where 
the desired metal is separated from unwanted tailings  
For example, zinc ore initially has a metal content of 3–7 
percent, but after the final stage of the concentration 
process, dewatering and filtration, it has a 55 percent zinc 
content  The residue left over is deposited in a tailings pond 
with surrounding dam structures  We systematically use 
mineralogical studies to optimize concentration and have 
a dedicated pilot facility where we evaluate methods and 
techniques for both existing and new minerals 
Smelters 
The last part of our internal value chain consists of our 
smelters  Using raw materials, of which roughly a third comes 
from Boliden’s mines, our smelters create finished products 
such as zinc with a metal content of 99 995 percent  Our 
smelters also recycle metals from secondary materials such 
as electronic scrap and used car batteries  The development 
of technology and skills, together with significant invest-
ments, allow us to continuously improve the environmental 
performance of our smelters, while the number of metal 
products and by-products, such as sulphuric acid, have 
increased over time  Diversification helps Boliden reduce 
cyclical sensitivity, and we store the waste from a number 
of smelters in underground repositories with the ambition 
of finding technologies in the future to help us extract even 
more products from the waste 
Being a good neighbor
We collaborate in matters large and small with 
different stakeholders in the communities 
where we operate  During the year we opened 
our first Sustainability Park  Learn more about 
it on page 7  
Energy supply 
With a good supply of fossil fuel-free energy, 
we can offer some of the most climate-friendly 
metals on the market  Read more about 
Boliden’s energy usage on page 32  
Reclamation 
Because our operations make use of land, 
we take long-term responsibility for the 
environment in which we operate  Read more

External sourcing of raw materials
The concentrates coming from 
Boliden’s own mines account for 
about one third of the raw mate-
rials feed to our smelters  External 
sourcing of the right raw material 
qualities, at the best commercial 
terms from business partners with 
high ESG performance, is there-
fore essential to Boliden 
External supply of raw materials crucial to smelter performance
Raw materials are selected to 
maximize the financial result 
within the technical constraints 
and minimize the CO2 footprint of 
raw material supply  We enter into 
long-term contracts with suppliers 
to ensure the reliability and quality 
of the raw material feed mix for 
the smelters  Since our Tara zinc 
mine was placed under care and 
maintenance in 2023, external 
mines supply about 60 percent of 
our smelters’ raw material needs 
and this is sourced from a large 
selection of partners globally  
Another 10 percent of the smelter 
feed consists of recycled materials 
like electronic scrap and spent car 
batteries  These are mainly sourced 
from European scrap collectors 
Sustainable partnerships with raw material suppliers
The ESG performance of all 
suppliers is evaluated to ensure 
adherence to internal stan-
dards  The risk-based evaluation 
includes a sanction screening and 
increasing levels of due dilligence 
through data gathering, interviews 
and on-site audits depending on 
the risk level  We work actively to 
help our raw material partners 
improve in areas such as emissions 
to the environment, anti-bribery 
and corruption measures and 
human rights  Finally, we also build 
partnerships with key suppliers 
focused on increased production 
of our low-carbon metals  
Recycling metals
With all of Boliden’s metals being 
fully recyclable, we have made 
circular metal production from 
end-of-life electronics and car 
batteries an integral part of our 
core business 
A world class recycler of electronics
Boliden’s smelter Rönnskär is one 
of the world’s largest recyclers of 
electronics with a capacity of recy-
cling 120,000 tonnes of electronic 
scrap annually  This amount equals 
2 million mobile phones every day  
Boliden buys electronic scrap con-
sisting of material such as printed 
circuit boards  The materials that 
are delivered to Boliden have been 
pre-processed by the suppliers  At 
Rönnskär, the material is crushed, 
smelted and refined in a Kaldo 
furnace  Boliden’s unique Kaldo 
technology utilizes the energy 
in the plastics from the material, 
making the process energy effi-
cient and enabling a multi-metal 
production from a number of 
different secondary materials 
Apart from electronic scrap recy-
cling, the Rönnskär plant also takes 
care of the residual materials from 
steel mills, brass foundries and 
power and heating plants  What 
gets disposed in society becomes 
new raw material at Rönnskär 
Enabling circularity in lead-acid battery technology
At our Bergsöe plant in 
Landskrona we recycle 50,000 
tonnes of lead annually – equal 
to four million car batteries 
every year  Production of lead at 
Bergsöe is a story of a true circular 
economy as almost 100 percent 
of all lead produced at Bergsöe 
comes from secondary sources 
and most of it also goes back to 
where it came from – as the main 
material in lead-acid car batteries

Business area highlights
Following a year of record-breaking highs, 2023 proved 
more varying with challenging external developments 
and internal events affecting production in several units 
Business Area Mines −Implementation of Global Industry Standard on Tailings 
Management continued, with progress including the 
implementation of a new governance system and rein-
forcement of Kevitsa and Garpenberg’s dam structures, 
as well as the ongoing SEK 5 billion project – one of 
Boliden’s biggest-ever investments – to reshape Aitik’s 
tailings facilities  −On track to becoming the world’s first fossil fuel-free 
mine, production at the Rävliden deposit in the Boliden Area 
started and the operation will be fully electric during the 
first half of 2025  −The start-up of production at Aitik’s Liikavaara deposit 
drew closer with the relocation of the E10 public road and 
the building of a road between the new open pit and the 
crusher  −A pilot for our Autonomous Hauling System – the first of its 
kind in Europe – was conducted in Aitik with seven trucks  
When implemented in 2024, 17 self-driving trucks will form 
part of our regular operations, with optimized driving 
performance and less idleness contributing to higher 
production capacity  −Due to a combination of a declining zinc price, high 
energy prices, operational challenges and general cost 
inflation, the Tara mine was placed under care and main-
tenance in July  Most of the workforce are on temporary 
furlough until the mine reopens  Planning for a restart 
during 2024 is ongoing, exploring how to create a more 
cost-efficient operation model with higher productivity  −Production challenges during the year affected Aitik, 
Garpenberg and Kevitsa which led to overall lower 
throughput and lower production of metal in concentrate 
than expected  
Business Area Smelters −All our smelters improved safety performance, which 
partly is considered a result of several acitivities aimed at 
strengthening our culture and employee engagement  −The major investment made into Harjavalta’s nickel line 
during the preceeding year started to pay off with pro-
duction successfully ramping up to design capacity  −In Harjavalta’s harbor, the Poseidon project – a state-of-
the art facility for fully automatic sampling of inbound 
raw materials – was delivered, shortening the lead time 
and increasing the capacity and accuracy of determining 
the value of purchased concentrates  −At Odda, the creation of the world’s most advanced zinc 
smelter reached peak intensity towards the end of the 
year with more than 1,000 employees and contractors 
working on the project  −A long-term process improvement program in Kokkola 
has improved productivity in operations  Kokkola also 
showed exceptional capability to adapt to volatility in 
electricity price  −Our Green Transition Metals product portfolio was 
expanded with the launch of Low-Carbon and Recycled 
Lead, as well as Low-Carbon Sulphuric Acid  −At Rönnskär, a fire in June destroyed the tank house, 
which is the last stage of the copper refinement process  
While no physical injuries were recorded, this had signif-
icant impact on financial results as the business model 
was transformed to selling copper anodes instead of 
cathodes  The prestudy for a potential new tank house 
was ongoing towards the end of the year

Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
We are proud to be able to offer our customers a number 
of metals with a low carbon footprint  Our Low-Carbon 
Copper and Low-Carbon Zinc emit 1 5 and 1 0 kilograms 
of carbon dioxide equivalents respectively per kilogram 
of metal produced, compared with global averages of 4 0 
for copper and 3 6 for zinc  During 2023, this lineup was 
complemented with Low-Carbon Lead and Low-Carbon 
Sulphuric Acid, with emission levels of 1 0 and 0 025 kilo-
grams of carbon dioxide equivalents respecitivly per kilo-
gram produced  Corresponding global average emissions 
amount to 1 87 kilograms for lead and 0 157 kilograms for 
sulphuric acid  
Through the processing of secondary materials including 
end-of-life electronics and car batteries, we also offer 
Recycled Copper, Recycled Zinc and Recycled Lead – all 
contributing to circularity in metal usage  
In the production of our Green Transition Metals, we con-
stantly challenge ourselves to find new ways of reducing our 
emissions, which in turn supports our customers’ efforts to 
reduce total emissions for the products containing our metals  
By sharing our know-how in this respect, we contribute to the 
green transition in the entire mining and metals industry 
Green Transition Metals
At the end of the year, 
our Green Transition 
Metals portfolio 
included seven 
products

Case
Boliden provides Tata Steel, one of the world’s major 
steel producers, with Low-Carbon Zinc, to be used in, for 
example, car manufacturing  Daniel Asplund, Boliden Sales 
Manager Zinc, shares his perspective on the deal, which was 
completed during the year 
How does the cooperation between Boliden and Tata 
Steel strengthen our role as a driver of sustainability 
within the metals industry? 
“The agreement with Tata Steel Nederland is further proof 
of our ambition to spearhead the industry  The partnership 
focuses on the provision of zinc with the lowest carbon 
footprint globally, reducing the CO2 emissions in Tata Steel’s 
production, which in turn creates a more sustainable steel 
offering, which is demanded especially by the automotive 
sector  We support our customers’ sustainability targets by 
helping them reduce scope 3 emissions and thus contribute 
to improving climate performance in their respective indus-
tries, in this case the steel sector ”
How does this deal impact the end customer? 
“Choosing Boliden’s Low-Carbon Zinc leads to a signifi-
cantly reduced carbon footprint  With emissions of 1 tonne 
CO2 per tonne zinc, compared to the average zinc product 
globally with emissions of 3 6 tonnes, the reduction equals 
the annual car usage of more than 25,000 households  The 
lower emissions level of our zinc contributes to our common 
commitment to environmental accountability and lower CO2 
emissions across the entire value chain  This not only reflects 
the strive for sustainability but also a strategic move to push 
the entire industry towards more climate-friendly produc-
tion methods ” 
What lies ahead for our Low-Carbon Zinc?
“While we will continue our efforts to produce zinc with 
minimal environmental impact, we are already today 
leading the industry in this respect  Demand is increasing 
and we see that our customers actively pursue alternatives 
with limited emissions levels, often as a response to scope 
3 targets set by their customers  And Boliden – not least 
through the added capacity generated by the ongoing 
expansion of Odda smelter and the continuous innovation 
taking place at Kokkola – will be part of providing more 
climate-friendly zinc both today and tomorrow ”
Low-Carbon Zinc bound for the automotive industry
Daniel Asplund 
Boliden Sales Manager Zinc
Through a partnership with Tata Steel, 
Boliden’s Low-Carbon Zinc will be used in 
car manufacturing 
The lower emissions level of 
our zinc contributes to our 
common commitment to 
environmental accountability 
and lower CO2 emissions

With care, courage and responsibility, 
Boliden strives to develop managers, 
employees and operations in a safe, 
healthy and inclusive work environment 
Safety first 
Occupational health and safety is our most important focus 
area as it involves the well-being and, ultimately, the lives 
of our employees and contractors  We have a zero-harm 
philosophy with regard to accidents and harm at work  A 
strong safety culture is characterized by a values-driven 
leadership that trusts employees’ ability to act in relation to 
risk, health, safety and well-being  We promote initiatives 
designed to engage employees on a more informal basis 
by encouraging them to submit suggestions for health and 
safety improvements  Risk assessment is a requirement of 
ISO 45001:2018, which all Boliden units are certified to, and 
involves internal and external audits on their risk assessment 
processes and performance  In 2023, employees and con-
tractors submitted 20,083 (19,555) risk reports 
The frequency of accidents with absence (LTI) has decreased 
since last year  The number of accidents resulting in absence 
from work, including contractors, was 77 (75)  The number 
of work days of absence due to accidents among Boliden 
employees was 709 (723)  The most common types of 
accidents included slip, trip and falls, and finger/hand inju-
ries while working with hand tools  The number of serious 
accidents has also decreased in recent years as a result of 
proactive safety work  Work-related fatalities are very rare 
within Boliden  No work-related fatalities have occurred 
on sites or areas controlled by Boliden since 2008, which is 
an exceptional result in the potential high-risk industry the 
company works in 
In 2023, 4,923 employees (84 percent of workforce) partic-
ipated in the annual employee survey “My Opinion”, which 
covers health, safety and well-being topics  The results were 
discussed in local working groups and a joint action plan 
with local measures will be implemented during 2024 to 
drive safety performance at all units  Additional support is 
provided to units with the greatest improvement potential 
Culture and leadership
Strengthening the values-driven corporate culture increases 
Boliden’s performance in all areas and the value creation 
for all stakeholders, and is also a prerequisite for Boliden 
to continue to be a leader within sustainability  The work 
to further establish the values, principles and related focus 
areas in the organization continued during 2023 through 
workshops and via the line management 
In 2023, Boliden’s annual General Management Meeting for 
our most senior managers explored how to further engage 
people, with the aim of unleashing the potential of our indi-
viduals, teams, and organizations  The key to engagement, 
performance and safety lies in a fearless organization char-
acterized by strong psychological safety, and the meeting 
participants were tasked with strengthening the focus on 
this in their respective teams  Diversity, equality and inclusion
Boliden needs a diversity of experiences, perspectives, 
and ideas to ensure strong business results and to build 
innovative and successful teams  Diversity perspectives are 
considered in selection and group composition in Boliden’s 
development programs as well as in recruitment processes  Boliden has the target to increase the share of women in its 
total workforce  In 2023, 30 percent of all new permanent 
employees were women  We also launched a new devel-
opment program, Female Professionals in Boliden, open to 
all employees who identify as female  The program aimed 
at strengthening the work in the field of gender equality 
and brings together women within the company to meet,

exchange experiences, collaborate and network  In May 
2023, Boliden also launched the research-based digital 
lecture “Diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) - Unlock 
Business Potential”, available to all employees  The purpose 
of the activity was to further strengthen our DEI work, 
provide knowledge about diversity, equality, and inclusion, 
and to increase awareness of unconscious biases 
Recruitment and retention
Attracting and retaining relevant competence is an 
important part of Boliden’s strategy and requires long-term 
planning and persistent work  The competition on the labor 
market is still increasing in many of the places where we 
operate, as a result of the industrial sector growth in those 
regions 
Many activities were conducted locally during the year, 
where Boliden interacts with selected schools and uni-
versities  In addition to meeting students, other import-
ant stakeholders such as study counsellors, education 
coordinators and employment services are involved  
Collaboration with local communities and other local com-
panies, with the aim of jointly increasing the attractiveness 
of the regions where Boliden has its operations, have also 
intensified during the year  
Retaining and developing existing employees is also a 
top priority  Boliden’s groupwide leadership and talent 
programs, together with local development programs were 
further developed during 2023  The first class of Boliden’s 
Trainee Program graduated during the year and the second 
group started the program in the fall of 2023

Employee interviews
Member of Boliden’s 2023/2024 trainee program and a 
Metallurgist/Process Engineer in Boliden Kevitsa  
What evoked your interest in the mining and metals 
sector?
“I chose to pursue my studies in metallurgical engineering 
at the bachelor level because the discipline covers a huge 
role in the supply chain of materials that is used in modern 
society and this makes the field worth practicing  Already 
there I realized there were great possibilities in optimizing 
minerals and metals extraction  Small improvements could 
have a huge impact on operations and contribute to the 
goal of improving sustainability in the mining and smelting 
industries  From there, I decided to do an International 
Master’s program in Sustainable and Innovative Natural 
Resource Management, during which I encountered many 
companies focused on raw materials processing  Boliden 
stood out in its ambitious sustainability targets and had a 
strong track record of taking action to achieve its targets  I wanted to become a part of that ”
Coming from tropical Sarangani in the Philippines on the 
other side of the world, how was settling into the north-
ernmost part of Finland? 
“The weather and seasons obviously constitute a major 
difference and then there’s the culture and language, but 
I really enjoy being here  I’m taking Finnish classes, have 
joined the local badminton club and do weekly ice swim-
ming  People can seem a bit quiet at first but once inside the 
sauna they are very talkative and entertaining  Around here 
there are also a lot of retired elderlies who are very warm in 
spirit and welcoming ”
Why should people apply to Boliden’s trainee program? 
“We are a very diverse group of trainees which ignites 
dynamic discussions and interesting exchanges of ideas – 
learning becomes more fun together in this group  While 
we all have individual roles at different business sites around 
Sweden and Finland, we do meet up regularly as part of 
the program and become exposed to all parts of Boliden’s 
operations  This program is the chance of a lifetime and a 
great way to get experience, where you will surely gain both 
personal and professional growth ”
Product and Process Engineering, Process development 
within the sampling department at Boliden Rönnskär  What is appealing about working with product and 
process engineering, especially in the context of 
Boliden? “Having the opportunity to work with research and develop-
ment on a daily basis  I’ve always been interested in metals 
and the product side of this work as well as technology and 
development, and this job really checks both boxes  My job 
is very flexible, and I am involved in everything from solving 
daily quality problems to investing in projects and research ” What is most challenging about your work? “Since my work includes generating ideas and perspectives 
on new research and development, it is necessary to have a 
network for collaboration, which can take time to build  In 
many cases, expert knowledge is required in a certain area 
and, when working with development, it helps a lot to get 
relevant advice and support on the issue  There are routines 
for this and contexts for exchanging experiences, which 
is very valuable in my job  At the same time, the personal 
network is important to be able to find experience of similar 
situations that can be applied to my specific challenges ” You joined Boliden less than a year ago, what was your 
first impression when you joined? “I got to know Boliden a bit already before I joined, thanks 
to a lecture at the university where I studied  I immediately 
realized that it is quite a large company with many separate 
plants that are run in completely different ways  When you 
include the mines as well, it becomes very complex  My first 
impression was that, despite the complexity, there was a lot 
of collaboration going on within the organization  During 
my first few months here at Boliden Rönnskär I have had the 
privilege of meeting many colleagues from different parts 
of the business ”

Operations
Contractor at Boliden Aitik’s major investment project 
aimed to ensure dam facility compliance with the Global 
Industry Standard on Tailings Management 
How did you end up working with Aitik 2050?
“This very large project started during the summer of 2022, 
and given its size, it had a very short time plan of only 
two years  As the planning proceeded, it became clear 
that Boliden was short on internal resources to handle all 
aspects of the project coordination and thus approached 
my employer Licab for support  Having worked at Boliden 
2012–2015 as a truck driver I knew the company well and 
saw a great opportunity in taking on this slightly chaotic 
project start and getting things in order and since February 
2023, as a consultant for Boliden, I have been coordinating 
the work of subcontractors in the many different disciplines 
we have in this massive project  To be able to reinforce the 
dam structures, a wide range of sub-projects needs to be 
carried out, such as building new pump stations, building 
new truck haul roads and large electricity and automations 
projects since the dam reinforcements impact the infra-
structure in Aitik ” 
How is Boliden’s focus on health and safety reflected for 
you as a consultant? 
“Boliden Aitik is very well known here in Gällivare for its 
safety culture and zero-target for injuries and this is also 
reflected in my experience as a consultant  The first week we 
had an extensive training in Health, Environment and Safety 
and this is a recurring topic in all our project meetings, as is 
the reporting system for any deviations from normal safety 
routines  In my role I am also responsible for ensuring that 
all coordination meetings with subcontractors also follow 
this pattern  Furthermore, we have one full-time Health, 
Metallurgy Operations Generalist, Purification Supervisory, 
Boliden Harjavalta What made you apply for a job at Boliden 21 years ago? 
“Just like it is today, Boliden was a large employer at the time 
and I had heard only good things about the company  This 
made me apply for an apprenticeship and after that I got 
a permanent job  Now I work as an operator in the liquid 
purification plant, taking samples, loading the acid trucks 
and much more ” 
What is most important to you in your work life? 
“There is a lot of variation in my daily work  I also think it’s 
important that the industry operates safely and respon-
sibly  Besides my job as an operator, I am also the deputy 
occupational health and safety representative and the 
department’s deputy union steward  As occupational health 
and safety representative, I need to ensure that everyone 
returns home safe and healthy after a day at work ” 
Why do you think someone should consider working in 
the mining and metals industry? 
“There are a great many interesting jobs in the field and I 
highly recommend working in it  Working at Boliden you will 
soon notice that we operate responsibly and with respect 
for the environment ” 
Environment and Safety consultant working on the project 
every day of the week, ensuring that there is always a 
person on site with overhead responsibility to handle any 
issues related to these particularly important topics ”
What are the pros and cons of being a consultant compared to being an employee? 
“As I have experience of being employed and am now 
working as a consultant here and know a lot of people 
working in different parts of Aitik, I can say that Boliden is 
generally a great company to work for  On the plus side, 
as a contractor I have easy access to further resources and 
competencies from my employer Licab if I need help on 
specific topics  On the other hand, as a consultant I lack 
the instant access to all the internal systems you have as an 
employee, and there are always areas both big and small 
where consultants naturally don’t have the mandate to 
take decisions  Being a Gällivare local with a large personal 
network of people employed at Aitik has helped me a lot in 
this respect!”

Improving our methodology
We have also reassessed the accounting methodology for cal-
culating our scope 1 emissions, leading to a restatement of our 
2021 and 2022 emissions  For example, we are now account-
ing for carbon dioxide equivalents, which is a standardized 
and comprehensive metric that includes emissions from all 
greenhouse gases  Accordingly, the green house gases are 
weighted by their global warming potential to show their 
warming impact using CO2 as a reference  In addition, we are 
now disclosing our actual full year data (instead of estimated 
December data as previously used), as well as including land 
use change emissions

Development during the year
During 2023, our scope 1 and 2 emissions fell by 8 percent 
compared to the previous year  The decrease was reinforced 
by Tara being put into care and maintenance and to some 
extent also by the production interruption caused by the fire 
in Rönnskär  However, the Rönnskär fire also had a negative 
impact on our production of Low-Carbon Copper while pro-
duction of Low-Carbon Zinc was affected by a prolonged 
maintenance shutdown in Odda  
Our roadmap for emissions reduction is progressing as 
planned and contributing activities during the year were, for 
example, replacing carbon-intensive cement with waste slag 
in Garpenberg, further electrification and full-scale use of 
nitrate free low-emission explosives in the Boliden Area and 
increasing the share of rail transportation between Kevitsa 
and Harjavalta  
Boliden is committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 
2 green house gas emissions, measured in carbon dioxide 
equivalents (CO2e), by 42 percent from base year 2021 until 
2030 (the target boundary includes biogenic land-related 
emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstock)  We also 
commit to reducing absolute scope 3 CO2e emissions by 
30 percent within the same time frame, as well as achieving 
copper and zinc production with CO2e emissions per kilo-
gram metal averaging 1 5 and 1 0 kilograms, respectively  
In December 2023, our scope 1 and 2 targets were validated 
and approved by The Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious 
emissions reductions targets in line with the latest climate 
science  The SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, the United 
Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) 
and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and one of the 
We Mean Business Coalition commitments  It defines and 
promotes best practice in science-based target setting, 
offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adop-
tion, and independently assesses and approves companies’ 
targets  Boliden has also committed its scope 3 target to 
SBTi  
Scope 3 – our value chain emissions 
We have established the baseline for our scope 3 emissions 
amounting to CO2e 2,814 ktonnes  Throughout the year, 
efforts have been prioritized to enhance the precision in 
accounting for our scope 3 emissions  We have developed an 
emissions accounting methodology based on in-house data, 
including actual spending, material usage, and information 
from direct suppliers , and third-party emission factors when 
actual emissions are not available from supplier  From 2024, 
we will report annually on scope 3 progress  Read more about 
our work with supplier data on page 33

Energy
Boliden’s operations are in many cases energy 
intensive, both in mining and smelting  Our 
electricity consumption totals almost 5 TWh per 
year and is expected to increase, not least with 
the Odda expansion being finalized in 2024  
Electrification drives energy demand in Mines
Within Business Area Mines there are several ongoing 
projects to increase the degree of electrification  The main 
objective of these projects is to increase productivity while 
reducing the amount of fossil fuel in the operation  Another 
important objective is to improve the work environment at 
the mines  Today, the main electricity consumption within 
the mines is related to the mills and crushers as well as 
conveyour belts  As the development progresses, transport 
vehicles, drill rigs and such will increase their share of elec-
tricity consumption  
Expansion of zinc production with fossil fuel-free energy
In Business Area Smelters, most electricity consumption is 
related to our zinc smelting in Kokkola and Odda  The latter 
has also secured a long term and fossil fuel-free energy 
contract which covers the increased energy consumption 
due to expanded operations during 2024  Rönnskär and 
Harjavalta are, however, also large energy consumers  Thus, 
the fire in Rönnskär meant that the energy consumption 
was somewhat reduced during the second half of the year  
Also within our smelting operations several projects related 
to electrification, including electrified vehicles, are being 
implemented  
Long-term energy supply
Our operations are largely located in areas with a good 
supply of fossil fuel-free energy and, to secure long-term 
low Scope 2 emissions, Boliden is actively working to 
improve conditions for fossil fuel-free energy production 
in national grids  The short-term aim is to have around 80 
percent of our electricity consumption secured through 
fixed contracts  Today, around 60 percent of our electricity 
consumption is hedged up to 2035 at competitve price 
levels and we are constantly monitoring the energy market 
for opportunities with the aim to balance the risk while 
supporting development programs at our units  During the 
year, Boliden also had revenues from the sale of electricity, 
partly because the operation optimizes production when 
the price of electricity peaks, and partly because of less 
than full production for other reasons such as unplanned 
maintenance stops

Procurement
To maximize Boliden’s procurement opportunities 
and secure uninterrupted sustainable operations, 
we work closely with suppliers to ensure they 
fulfill our requirements in areas such as quality, 
occupational health and safety, and sustainability 
performance 
Constructive relationships with suppliers 
Responsible sourcing and contributing to a sustainable 
supply chain are key responsibilities of the procurement 
function  Through established processes we ensure adher-
ence to our requirements and take action to reduce risk and 
contribute to the development of our suppliers  We apply 
continuous learning and improvement to ensure efficiency 
and effectiveness in our supply chain activities 
Before signing contracts with suppliers, we perform 
sanctions controls and check that the supplier complies 
with Boliden’s black lists, Boliden Business Partner Code of 
Conduct and Boliden’s requirements regarding quality and 
occupational health and safety  
We strive to make sure that suppliers maintain a high level 
of compliance and fully understand Boliden’s strategy, and 
want to enable their development in line with our evolving 
requirements  Therefore, we continuously follow up on our 
suppliers’ performance, maintain dialogues and continu-
ously inform them about our own development 
Climate and Scope 3
Procurement plays an important role in the path towards 
reaching Boliden’s ambitious climate targets for 2030  
Strategic activities, under development during 2023, will aid 
Scope 3 reduction activities within both our business areas 
through supplier engagement and by ensuring a transpar-
ent and comparable climate performance assessment in the 
sourcing process  Primary data collection from suppliers 
and reporting will be key activities in refining and measuring 
the carbon footprint of Boliden’s supply chain  During 2024 through 2025, focus will be on establishing a 
reliable reduction roadmap together with our internal stake-
holders as well as suppliers  The direction will be set through 
targets for selected suppliers, categories and products, 
which will enable us to track our progress and direct our 
resources effectively on our path to Boliden’s climate target

Operations
| Environment
Environment
Our operations have, by their nature, a signficant 
impact on the environment  Minimizing this and 
compensating where possible is a prerequisite for 
achieving our vision to be the most climate-friendly 
and respected metal provider in the world  
Environmental impact
We have an impact on the local environment due to emis-
sions, acidification, contribtion to eutrophication, noise and 
changes in the landscape  We also have a global footprint due 
to carbon dioxide emissions  Because our metals are needed 
for the climate transition, we also have a far-reaching respon-
sibility to limit our environmental impact and we constantly 
measure our performance in this respect  Our ultimate ambi-
tion is to ensure zero harm to people and the environment 
Collaboration with stakeholders
We cannot define what our impact on people and the envi-
ronment is on our own, therefore it is essential that we have 
a close dialogue with the people that are impacted by our 
operations and that have a stake in what we do  We initiate 
partnerships and relationships with for example indigenous 
peoples, environmental organizations and local communi-
ties to ensure our environmental impact is managed in the 
best possible way 
Water management
All our operations are located in areas deemed as low water 
stress areas  Our challenges related to water, in particular 
at our mines, lie whithin the management of water that is 
released during operations  All operations, at both mines 
and smelters, measure the impact on water bodies in 
comprehensive water management programs to ensure we 
minimize any risk to life in water and on land  During 2023, 
the discharges of metals to water increased  The underlying 
reasons for this were challenges with the water treatment 
systems at our Odda and Rönnskär smelters  This is being 
addressed by, for example, the construction of a new water 
treatment plant at Odda 
Resource usage and turning waste into value
Our most important target for waste regards safe waste 
management, which we have formalized in the target 
to implement Global Industry Standard for Tailings 
Management (GISTM) at all our tailings facilities, located 
at both active and closed operations, by 2025  We are 
also committed to minimizing the current waste streams 
at our operations  We are driving projects that aim to 
produce products from current residue and recover more 
valuable metals, an area where we see vast opportunities  
For instance, we have developed a carbon dioxide free 
Supplementary Cementitious Material – a product possible 
to produce from all iron containing residues that come as 
a waste stream from the metal production at our smelters  
For other hazardous waste streams containing elements 
such as mercury, arsenic or cadmium, we store the waste 
in safe repositories underground or in mountain caverns, 
while performing research and development targeted at 
finding use cases for it  These solutions help to eliminate the 
hazardous elements from being used in society and protect 
the environment from harm

Operations
Biodiversity
The degradation of ecosystems and biodiversity 
is a growing concern and highlights the strong 
relationship between nature and human activi-
ties  Our operations have a negative impact on 
ecosystems and biodiversity when using land for 
mining and smelting, and we have a number of 
activities aimed at compensating for this 
Contributing to biodiversity by 2030
To compensate for our impact we have set the target to 
contribute positively to biodiversity by 2030 in all regions 
where we operate  Our operations shall be sustainable 
throughout the entire value chain – from prospecting and 
production, through closure planning and closure in the 
long-term  One core principle for achieving increased 
biodiversity is to operate in accordance with a mitigation 
hierarchy: avoid any impact if possible, minimize impact that 
cannot be avoided, restore impacts through rehabilitation 
and ecological restoration and compensate for any residual 
impacts 
Biodiversity Management Plans have been developed for 
our Kevitsa and Garpenberg sites, and plans for the remain-
ing business units are in progress  The plans reinforce how 
we work with biodiversity and ultimately strive toward cre-
ating a net gain for biodiversity at our sites in collaboration 
with local communities and other key stakeholders  
Boliden assesses biodiversity performance at our operating 
sites and demonstrates responsible management by miti-
gating and reversing biodiversity impacts while sustaining 
the facilities’ dependencies  
A selection of compensation activities during 2023 −At Kylylahti the work with the extensive plan for ecologi-
cal rehabilitation at the closed mine site was completed  
This involved the creation of wildflower meadows and 
wetlands, and biodiversity enhancements in existing 
woodlands with the creation of dead wood habitats and 
controlled burning  −Rehabilitation of the closed mine site in Långdal continued 
with an extensive program for ecological rehabilitation, 
both on land and in water  The plan includes re-establish-
ment of different forms of ecosystem services and to bring 
people back to the site by developing a sustainability park  −Partnerships were established to harvest meadow 
cuttings from a local conservation area, as well as tree 
planting for each visiting artist at the Skellefteå concert 
hall to recreate a deciduous woodland  −Extensive ecological rehabilitation was initiated at the 
closed mine Rävlidmyren, where earth works are com-
pleted and habitats will be created in 2024  −At the zinc smelter in Kokkola the sea was stocked with 
around 52,000 whitefish and 26,000 trout to compensate 
for the impact of effluents on fish stocks  In addition, in 
co-operation with local fishermen and fishing commu-
nities we aim to stock 3 5 million juvenile whitefish every 
year  −Boliden’s first Sustainability Park, called Sarkanenä, was 
opened near Aitik  Read more about it on page 7

Tailings and dam 
safety management
Potential incidents at our tailings storage facilities 
constitute one of the most severe environmental risks 
for Boliden and adhering to the highest international 
standards for dam safety is therefore necessary for our 
success as a company 
Boliden’s tailings storage facilities 
Safe and responsible management of tailings storage 
facilities is of high importance to Boliden  These consist of 
tailings and clarification ponds with dam structures and 
associated critical infrastructure such as those for handling 
and treating water and conveying tailings  Tailings from the 
concentrator are deposited in the tailings pond, along with 
process water created as a result of our operations  In order 
to reduce the amount of water stored in the tailings pond, 
excess water is led from the pond to the clarification pond  
This water is recycled as process water or is purified before 
being returned to the surrounding watercourses 
Procedures and organization 
Boliden has set up a tailings and dam safety manage-
ment system that administers the facilities for which we 
are responsible  We manage the risks continuously in a 
systematic way to ensure that the function and abilities of 
the structure meet international standards, meaning that 
risk levels are kept as low as virtually possible  Every tailings 
storage facility has its own dam safety organization to 
ensure compliance with laws, requirements, standards and 
obligations  Monitoring takes place in the form of regular 
inspections, sometimes drone assisted, and readings col-
lected from instrumentation by means of innovative solu-
tions are evaluated against set limits  In the event of a devi-
ation from a limit value, there are established emergency 
procedures and action plans  Boliden also uses independent 
auditors at regular intervals to continuously improve and 
ensure compliance with best international standards

started in April 2023 and will run for two years  The dam safety measures consist of stabilization through exten-
sive foundation preparation and buttressing work to 
improve the stability of some of the dam embankments  
The project also includes relocation and reconstruction 
of impacted infrastructure such as pump stations and 
haulage roads  −Garpenberg was permitted to continue the initiated change to centerline dam construction  −Implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management continued

Operations
Reclamation
Our presence has a significant impact on the 
landscape where we operate and it is both 
out of legal and moral obligation to reclaim 
the land once operations have ceased to 
ensure its accessibility to future generations  
Reclamation of active and closed sites
An important part of Boliden’s work after mining has ceased 
is the reclamation of the land we used to ensure the land 
can be used again in the future  In addition to the succes-
sive reclamation measures carried out at active facilities, 
we manage around 30 closed sites  These historical sites 
are monitored systematically and reclamation activities are 
carried out where needed 
Area-specific methods 
Conditions such as topography, water flows, groundwater 
levels, and the nature of waste determine the methods used 
in reclamation, and according to global guidelines, every 
active mine should draw up a site-specific mine closure plan  
To minimize our environmental impact in closed mining 
areas, we carry out collaborative projects with a large 
number of organizations, universities and companies, and 
also conduct research to develop new technologies with the 
aim to, for example, promote biodiversity  Depending on 
the wishes of the local community, reclamation can, in addi-
tion to the restoration of nature, also be directed toward 
creating added value in the form of recreational areas or 
favorable conditions for other industries 
Development during 2023 −We increased our provisions for reclamation by SEK 3 8 
billion  The reason for this was mainly to ensure effective 
reclamation after the closure of Aitik as its expected life of 
mine, subject to permit, has been extended by approxi-
mately 20 years  −The remediation project at the Åkerberg mine contin-
ued during 2023  Crushed waste rock was transported 
to Kankberg, to be used as backfill in the mine  Road 
material to all mines in the Boliden area has also been 
produced and delivered from Åkerberg  Electric crushing 
at the site started and will continue over the coming years  −The second year of the reclamation project in Rävlidmyr 
mine focused on covering the mine waste that was exca-
vated from the site in 2022 with a layer of ­
compacted till  
Extracted from a local burrow at the site, due to its natural 
clay content the till is suitable for creating a compacted 
low permeable layer on top of the mine waste to prohibit 
further oxidation and infiltration  The technical part 
of the remediations was completed and finalization of 
the project ecological reclamation, in accordance with 
Bolidens Biodiversity commitment, is planned for 2024  −The feasibility project for land remediation and res-
toration of part of the southern industrial area in 
Garpenberg, the site of the former processing plant, 
was finalized  Remediation works have begun and, with 
consecutive covering of mine waste, will continue during 
2024 and 2025  −Closure planning of the open pit in Boliden has contin-
ued with numerical ground water modelling as a tool 
to support the decision between closure options  The 
open pit is situated amidst several legacy and opera-
tional assets  Thus, improving the understanding of the 
complex situation has been a key to finding a suitable 
closure option  −Closure planning in Maurliden has entered the feasibility 
stage  The project evaluates aspects such as ground and 
surface water management, closure of the waste rock 
facility including relocation, remediation and reclamation, 
as well as pit backfill with low permeability filling material  
The preparation of a permit application for the improve-
ments in the planned closure is also underway

| Responsible business
Responsible business
Good ethics are essential for sustainable, 
successful business  This is reflected both in 
the way we conduct our own operations and 
in our relationships with business partners 
Ethics and compliance
The Group function for Ethics and Compliance supports 
the company to operate in accordance with the relevant 
regulatory frameworks, international law and regulations, 
the EU’s legal regulations and national law  Furthermore, the 
function makes sure Boliden’s operations are conducted in 
accordance with Boliden’s internal policies and instructions  
The department is responsible for the strategic develop-
ment and coordination of the Group’s work in the areas of 
anti-corruption, competition law, personal data protection, 
sanctions, human rights, anti-money laundering and terror-
ist financing  
Additional responsibilities include compliance with Boliden’s 
Code of Conduct and Business Partner Code of Conduct, as 
well as handling and investigating matters reported through 
Boliden’s whistleblower system  The function also supports 
the commercial departments, including procurement and 
sales, in the evaluation of business partners from an ethical 
and compliance perspective 
Since 2022, the function conducts an annual assessment of 
ethical risks together with participants from all parts of the 
organization 
The Code of Conduct 
The Code of Conduct provides a framework for corporate 
responsibility based on the company’s values and ethical 
principles  All employees and members of the Board 
are subject to the Code of Conduct, which is based on 
international standards and relevant legislation, and which 
expresses the Group’s values  As a complement to the Code, 
there are internal policies related to a large number of areas 
that all employees are expected to comply with  
In 2023, Boliden launched and rolled out a Code of Conduct 
handbook to the whole organization  The handbook 
elaborates on our Code of Conduct policy and other Group 
policies, and serves as a practical guideline for ethical behav-
ior within our organization  In addition there is mandatory 
training for all employees, as an e-learning or classroom 
training  All employees must conduct the training in one year, 
between the fourth quarter 2023 and the third quarter 2024  
For all new employees it is a part of the onboarding process 
and it must be completed within the first month of employ-
ment  From its launch on October 1 until year end, 2,722 
employees completed Boliden’s Code of Conduct training 
Anti-corruption and anti-money laundering
Boliden has policies, processes and procedures to make 
sure the necessary measures are in place and has trained 
employees in order to increase awareness of how to behave 
to combat bribery, corruption and money laundering  These 
are priority measures to minimize business risks and avoid 
fines, sanctions and reputational risks related to this area  
During 2023, 1,340 (993) employees completed Boliden’s 
anti-corruption training  The company had 0 (0) confirmed 
cases of corruption during 2023 
Competition law 
In 2023, we continued to strengthen employee awareness 
of, and compliance with, applicable competition law  Based 
on the risk assessment carried out during the previous year, 
updated steering documents were published and training 
was conducted for the relevant business units and employ-
ees  During the year, there were 0 (0) initiated or ongoing 
legal actions with respect to anti-competitive behavior 
Sanctions
Boliden keeps up to date with the latest international sanc-
tions and has good knowledge of its business partners and 
their potential connections with sanctioned parties  Since 
several years back, Boliden has had a sanctions policy with 
accompanying guidelines that all employees must comply 
with  This is especially important for the procurement and 
sales departments, and other departments dealing with 
external business partners, who must conduct sanctions 
control on all existing and potential business partners 
before entering a new agreement  Continuous screen-
ings are conducted for the existing supplier and customer 
base  All contractual agreements include specific sanctions 
clauses 
In 2023, sanctions training was conducted for several 
departments and 99 employees completed the training  
Evaluation of business partners 
Boliden acquires raw materials, energy, services and 
equipment from suppliers around the world  Operating in a 
global market, with different legislation, ethical approaches, 
working conditions and environmental standards, requires 
an overarching strategy for managing risks in the supply 
chain to ensure operating permits  
Our Business Partner Code of Conduct applies to all 
business partners, including customers and suppliers, and 
reflects the minimum requirements we place on them  
Business partners must approve our Business Partner Code 
of Conduct as well as ESG and sanctions clauses as part of 
the agreement  The Code specifically addresses require-
ments within human rights, labor rights, health and safety, 
environment, responsible value chain, business ethics and

anti-corruption, and it prohibits the use of conflict minerals  
It requires that the same principles be applied throughout 
the business partner’s own supply chain  We also include 
the option of terminating the agreement in the event of a 
material breach of our Business Partner Code of Conduct  
Boliden’s Business Partner Code of Conduct was updated 
during 2023 to better align with the latest Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
guidelines  The Business Partner Code of Conduct is further 
aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights standards, and our inter-
nal commitments to comply with various international 
standards, such as the International Council on Mining and 
Metals (ICMM) 
Boliden monitors compliance with the Business Partner 
Code of Conduct by conducting, for example, regular risk 
assessments, business partner audits, interviews and fol-
low-up meetings 
Transparency 
Boliden publishes an annual report on payments to authori-
ties  The report covers payments to government authorities 
in Sweden, Finland and Ireland related to extractive industry 
operations  Boliden also supports the Extractive Industries 
Transparency Initiative, which demands good corporate 
governance in those countries where the regulations are 
implemented 
Human rights 
Since 2022, Boliden has a human rights commitment and 
has for a longer time had several other human rights-related 
policies and commitments as regarding, for example, indig-
enous peoples and diversity  Boliden has also embedded 
human rights due diligence into the management systems 
by integrating it into several different business processes, 
including global and local human rights impact assess-
ments, business partner evaluations and audits, business 
partner contracting and the annual risk process 
Being subject to the Norwegian Transparency Act, Boliden 
is obliged to conduct due diligence on an ongoing basis  
During 2023, Boliden conducted several activities to 
strengthen its approach to human rights and human rights 
due diligence  Comprehensive training was offered to key 
personnel across the organization, a human rights working 
group was established, a human rights due diligence gap 
analysis was conducted and local human rights impact 
assessments were conducted on two of the mine sites  The 
human rights impact assessment reports showed a total of 7 
heightened human rights impacts, and 5 that were deemed 
salient  The salient impacts cover workplace health and 
safety (for example severe physical injuries and exposure to 
toxic materials), contractors and supply chain (for example 
discrimination and forced labor), indigenous peoples (Sámi, 
for example negative effects on their cultural heritage), 
tailings and water (for example dam breach or environmen-
tal impacts negatively affecting peoples’ life)  A roadmap 
for continued work with human rights and human rights 
due diligence is under development and will be finalized by 
the beginning of 2024  The roadmap will build on the gap 
analysis together with the salient impacts  
Our Diversity Policy states that if a discrimination incident 
should occur, the affected employee shall initially raise the 
matter with their manager and then with the company’s HR 
function, or through the whistleblower reporting system 
(accessible via the intranet and Boliden’s external website) 
During 2023, 3 incidents of discrimination were reported 
through formal grievance mechanisms  These were 
reviewed and remediation plans were implemented for all 
with the results reviewed through a routine of practice 
Reporting grievances and wrongdoings
The Group has operated a whistleblower channel for several 
years that allows internal and external stakeholders to 
safely and anonymously report suspected or actual serious 
irregularities and wrongdoings  22 (16) cases were reported 
via the whistleblower channel throughout 2023  Both the 
whistleblower channel and stakeholder portal for griev-
ances are accessible from Boliden’s external website  From 
2023, all labor law consequences are regularly reported and 
followed up centrally  If any irregularities are discovered 
from investigations, disciplinary actions must be taken  
Reprisals against anyone submitting reports in good faith 
will not be tolerated  Group management and the Board 
receive regular reports on risks, deviations, action plans and 
compliance

In vast parts of Sweden and Finland, the Sami population, 
which is recognized as indigenous peoples, have specific 
rights which affects Boliden’s way of working when it comes 
to both operations and developing projects  To highlight 
and ensure these special rights, Boliden has together with

position statement  
In relation to the commitments above, Boliden seeks to 
engage with potentially impacted indigenous peoples to 
ensure that the development of mining and metals projects 
fosters respect for the rights, interests, aspirations, culture 
and natural resource-based livelihoods of indigenous 
peoples  When applicable, we also seek to design projects 
to avoid adverse impacts and to minimize, manage or 
compensate unavoidable impacts in line with the mitigation 
hiearchy  Lastly, we also seek to ensure sustainable benefits 
and opportunities for indigenous peoples when developing 
mining and metals projects  Many of Boliden’s operations 
have been in production for several decades, and dialogues 
as well as collaborations have been developed accordingly  
Dialogues and knowledge development
Apart from exploration activities, the mining units affected 
by the special rights of indigenous peoples are Aitik, the 
Boliden Area, Garpenberg and Kevitsa  In recent years, 
much emphasis has also been put on ensuring these rights 
and the mitigation hierarchy in the development projects 
Liikavara and Nautanen around Aitik as well as the expan-
sion of the Kankberg mine in the Boliden Area  
In order to find ways for the mining industry and indigenous 
peoples to co-exist in the long run, Boliden pursues knowl-
edge development and continual dialogues to provide the 
right framework and conditions for such co-existence  The 
possibility to remediate former mining areas so they may 
once more serve as, for example, functional reindeer hus-
bandry areas is also a crucial matter within this context  
Within Business Area Smelters, Boliden purchases concen-
trates from other mining companies  To ensure that the 
special rights of indigenous peoples are not endangered 
in our supply chain we conduct a due diligence process, 
where risks and activities are outlined, before any contracts 
are signed  When applicable, we also follow up the results 
through on site audits to ensure that indigenous peoples 
are respected

Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities before changes in 
working capital was SEK 11,461 m (19,148)  Including a change 
in working capital, the total was SEK 12,183 m (16,398)  The 
transformation of Rönnskär’s business model, from selling 
copper cathodes to selling copper anodes, increased the 
running working capital level by about SEK 1 billion  However, 
this was partly compensated by less tied-up working capital 
as a result of lower metal prices  The decrease in working 
capital tied-up contributed positively to cash flow in the 
amount of SEK 722 m (-2,750)  Free cash flow totaled SEK 
-3,354 m (6,329) and tax paid for the year was SEK 1,763 m 
(2,815)  
Financial position 
On December 31, 2023, Boliden’s net debt was SEK 10,728 m 
(-15), which corresponds to a net debt/equity ratio of 19 percent (0)  Equity was SEK 56,420 m (58,325), including 
the mark-to-market of currency and interest rate derivatives 
in the amount of SEK 290 m (262) net after tax effect  The 
average term of Boliden’s total approved loan facilities at 
year-end was 3 3 years (3 4)  As of December 31, 2023 the 
average interest rate in the debt portfolio was 4 3 percent 
(2 5), and the fixed interest term was 1 1 years (1 7)  At year-
end, Boliden’s current liquidity, in the form of cash and cash 
equivalents and unutilized committed credit facilities with a 
term of more than one year, totaled SEK 14,843 m (23,005)

The Parent Company Boliden AB conducts limited opera-
tions and is in a tax agreement with Boliden Mineral AB  For further information, see page 83 
Guidelines for remuneration to the CEO and other senior ­
executives 
Boliden’s remunerations to senior executives consist of fixed 
salary, variable remuneration, pension benefits and other 
benefits  Remunerations to senior executives are described 
in note 5  
Sales revenues and operating profit
Boliden’s sales revenues in 2023 totaled SEK 78,554 m 
(86,437) and operating income totaled SEK 8,287 m (15,895)  
Lower volumes primarily due to lower grades in mines, the 
fire in Rönnskär and cost inflation caused the deteriora-
tion in earnings  In addition, prices and terms contributed 
negatively  Excluding process inventory revaluation, the 
consolidated operating profit was SEK 7,810 m (15,672)  The 
operating profit for Business Area Mines was SEK 3,111 m 
(9,318), and the operating profit for Business Area Smelters 
excluding revaluation of process inventory was SEK 4,485 m 
(5,916)  The absence of a tank house had a major negative 
impact on Rönnskär’s profitability  This was due to lower 
metal premiums and refining charges, as well as a decreased 
volume of free metals  Scheduled maintenance shutdowns 
for Smelters burdened profits with SEK -670 m (-500) in the 
forms of lower production and higher costs  Consolidated 
operating costs before depreciation increased to SEK 21,551 
m (20,059), primarily due to inflation  Earnings for 2023 
included an item affecting comparability in the amount 
of SEK -53 m for early retirements in Tara, and SEK -163 
m related to the Rönnskör fire  In addition, earnings were 
affected negatively by SEK 200 m linked to Rönnskär’s lost 
production and cancelled deliveries  Earnings for 2023 also 
included an insurance payment of 176 SEK m  This payment 
relates to the flooding in Tara in the fourth quarter of 2021  
Finally, earnings for 2023 included restructuring costs 
in Smelters amounting to SEK -55 m, consisting of early 
retirement costs in Rönnskär and asset write-downs in Odda  
Earnings for 2022 included an item affecting comparability in 
the amount of SEK -259 m attributable to an impairment of 
exploration rights in Finland  
Capital expenditure
Boliden’s capital expenditure in 2023 totaled SEK 15,515 m 
(10,022)  In Mines, the capital expenditure in a new dam 
structure in Aitik was one of the year’s major projects, as was 
the expansion of the Rävliden deposit in the Boliden Area  
The largest investment in Smelters was the Odda expansion  
Financial development during the year
1)
Boliden’s earnings for 2023 decreased compared 
to the previous year  Lower volumes primarily due 
to lower grades in mines, the fire in Rönnskär and 
cost inflation caused the deterioration in earnings  
Prices and terms also contributed negatively

of exploration rights which was not the case in 2023  Aitik’s 
operating profit was significantly lower than in 2022  The 
decrease was due to a negative combination of lower 
metal prices, grades and milled volumes, along with higher 
costs  The Boliden Area’s operating profit was below the 
record profit of 2022, primarily due to lower metal prices  
Garpenberg’s operating profit decreased, year on year, due 
to less favorable market terms but also some disturbances 
in production  As such, Garpenberg failed to deliver record 
earnings for the third consecutive year  Kevitsa’s operating 
profit decreased substantially  Lower metal prices, lower 
grades and operational issues contributed negatively  Tara’s 
minor positive operating profit in 2022 turned into a large 
operating loss in 2023  In June 2023, it was resolved to place 
the Tara mine under care and maintenance  The mine was 
cash flow negative due to a combination of factors including 
a decline in the zinc price, high energy prices and treatment 
charges, general cost inflation and operational challenges 
The business area’s earnings for 2023 included an item

The majority of Business Area Mines sales are to Business 
Area Smelters, and take place on market terms  Revenues 
decreased to SEK 18,683 m (24,755), of which external sales 
totaled SEK 1,331 m (1,611)  The operating profit for Mines 
decreased from last year’s record level to SEK 3,111 m (9,318) 
mainly due to a combination of lower metal prices, grades 
and milled volumes  Total operating costs for Mines before 
depreciations were SEK 11,444 m (11,119)  This corresponds 
to an increase of 3 percent (19) in local currency  External 
services contributed negatively while lower personnel 
expenses contributed positively  Capital expenditure totaled 
SEK 8,742 m (6,159)  Major projects included investments in 
a new dam construction and a new water treatment system 
in Aitik, the initial face of the Liikavaara project, also in Aitik, 
and the expansion of the Rävliden deposit in the Boliden 
Area  Depreciations decreased to SEK 4,488 m (4,661), 
mainly as a result of decreased production of metal in 
concentrate  Depreciations in 2022 included an impairment

Production Mines
The Business Area’s milled volume was lower in 2023 
compared to 2022  In addition, lower grades contributed 
negatively, which resulted in a lower production of metal 
in concentrate for all metals  However, production was 
positively affected by more normal rates of sick leave 
post Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the loading and 
haulage capacity in the open pits  Nevertheless, milled 
volumes in both Aitik and Kevitsa were below the record 
levels from 2022  Aitik only achieved its designed annual 
production rate of 45 Mtonnes of milled volume in the 
second quarter of 2023  Several production issues con-
tributed negatively  An unplanned maintenance stop and 
unusually unfavorable weather conditions lowered Aitik’s 
fourth quarter milled production by 2 Mtonnes  Because of 
an unplanned adjustment to the mining plan in Kevitsa, a 
larger proportion of mined production took place in areas 
with lower grades  Kevitsa’s nickel grade fell 11 percent year 
on year  Garpenberg’s milled volume reached a new annual 
record, despite some operational shortfalls  However, 
this was counteracted by lower grades leading to a lower 
production of zinc in concentrate compared to 2022  The 
Boliden Area’s production of metal in concentrates fell short 
of 2022 mainly due to lower grades  Tara’s milled volumes 
decreased by 47 percent relative to 2022 as the mine was 
placed under care and maintenance from July until the end 
of the year and its mill stopped on July 5  This contributed to 
a 25 percent decrease in Boliden’s total production of zinc in 
concentrate compared to 2022  
The decrease in the production of gold in concentrate is primarily explained 
by lower grades in Aitik and Kevitsa  
The production of lead in concentrate decreased due to Tara in care and 
maintenance  Metal in concentrate, gold Metal in concentrate, silver Metal in concentrate

6,773 m (3,862)  The largest investment in Smelters was the 
expansion in Odda  Depreciations increased to SEK 1,729 m 
(1,472), as a result of increased capital expenditure  
The fire that broke out in Rönnskär in June led to items 
affecting comparability totaling SEK –163 m  In addition, 
earnings in the second quarter were affected negatively 
by SEK 200 m linked to Rönnskär’s lost production and 
cancelled deliveries  The absence of a tank house had a 
major negative impact on Rönnskär’s profitability also for 
the remainder of the year  This was due to lower metal pre-
miums and refining charges, as well as a decreased volume 
of free metals  Harjavalta noted lower earnings compared to 
the 2022 all time high  Harjavalta’s earnings decrease should 
mainly be seen in the light of lower nickel prices  However, 
improved productivity in the nickel line contributed 
Financial information Smelters
Revenues for Business Area Smelters totaled SEK 77,197 m 
(84,787), and gross profit excluding revaluation of process 
inventory was SEK 15,577 m (15,703)  Operating profit, 
excluding revaluation of process inventory, decreased from 
the 2022 business area record to SEK 4,485 m (5,916)  This 
was mainly as a result of lower volumes  Including a revalua-
tion of process inventory in the amount of SEK 477 m (223), 
operating profit totaled SEK 4,962 m (6,139)  Total operating 
costs for Smelters before depreciations were SEK 9,635 m 
(8,652)  This corresponds to an increase of 12 percent (19) 
in local currency  Costs increased largely driven by inflation 
and higher planned maintenance work  However, lower 
energy prices had a positive effect  Operating profit was 
affected in the amount of SEK –670 m (–500) by planned

positively  Kokkola reported its highest operating earnings 
since 2006 and Odda set a new record  Both zinc smelters 
benefited from improved zinc treatment charges and higher 
metal premiums  Bergsöe’s earnings increased compared 
to 2022 thanks to improved process efficiency  Its operating 
earnings were the strongest since 2007  The operating profit 
item “Other Smelters”, which includes earnings from the 
Group’s joint purchasing and sales companies, worsened 
in 2023 compared to 2022  This was due to deteriorating 
prices and terms  
Production Smelters
The production of nickel in matte in Harjavalta reached 
a new record  Less planned maintenance, higher nickel 
content in raw materials and a more stable produc-
tion process contributed positively  However, Smelters’ 
production of gold did not reach the record from 2022  The 
fire in Rönnskär had a negative effect  The silver production 
fell sharply due to an equipment failure in Harjavalta  After 
the fire, Rönnskär, only produced anode copper, which led 
to a 55 percent year-on-year drop in its finished copper 
production  Zinc production decreased by 4 percent in 2023 
compared to 2022  Low availablity of zinc concentrates, in 
the third quarter, and process disturbances had a nega-
tive effect  In addition, due to commercial reasons, part of 
Odda’s production capacity was permanently closed on 
December 1st pending its new expansion  Lead production 
increased 7 percent relative to 2022  Production of lead 
alloys in Bergsöe reached a new record  The production of 
sulphuric acid was stable at a historically high level  Metal production, gold Metal production, silver Lead production Lead alloys
Gold and silver production
Production of lead and lead alloys
The absence of a tank house in Rönnskär had a negative effect on precious metal production 
Lead production was lower than the previous year

Highlights
Development is ongoing to start production during 2024 in 
Rävliden (Kristineberg) and in Liikavaara (Aitik)  Exploration 
continues to give good results in Nautanen north of Aitik  
Due to a combination of factors causing unsustainable cash 
outflow, our Tara mine was placed under care and mainte-
nance in July 2023 
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves
Boliden follows SveMin’s recommendations for reporting 
exploration results, Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources 
and strives to report according to the Pan-European 
Reserves and Resources Reporting Committee (PERC)  The 
PERC standard is an internationally recognized reporting 
standard that has been recognized by SveMin in Sweden, 
FinnMin in Finland and Norsk Bergindustri in Norway for 
exploration and mining companies in the Nordic countries 
Aitik
In Aitik, Liikavaara is just about to come into production  
Liikavaara is a part of Aitik Mineral Resource and Mineral 
Reserve and will be included in the production from 2024  
Exploration and evaluation are also underway at the 
Nautanen deposit approximately 15 km north of Aitik, which 
is reported separately 
An improved and more specified cost model led to pit 
design changes and increased Mineral Reserves of 12 
Mtonnes, despite mining of 41 Mtonnes in 2023  The Mineral 
Resource, which in the open pit involves tonnage that, with 
today’s estimated prices and costs, lies outside the planned 
final open pit, decreased by 200 Mtonnes

Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are the 
foundation for the future viability of a mining 
company’s operations  As Mineral Reserves are reduced 
every year through mining activities, new additions 
through exploration and technical studies are vital to 
the viability of the operations 
| Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves

Operations
Boliden Area
In the Boliden Area, the total Mineral Reserves increased by 
1 2 Mtonnes (10%) mainly by converting mineral resources in 
the Rävliden mineralisation in Kristineberg  New resources 
added by exploration have been limited and since larger 
quantities are converted to reserves the resources have 
decreased with 2 0 Mtonnes (7%)  1 6 Mtonnes were milled 
in the Boliden Area in 2023 
Garpenberg
In Garpenberg, successful exploration activities, infill drilling 
and technical studies have for many years given a significant 
increase in both Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves  
However, this year the reserve decreased by 8 4 Mtonnes 
(8%) due to higher cut-off, redesign and 3 1 Mtonnes milled 
in 2023  The resource increased marginally with 0 5 Mtonnes 
(0 6%)

Kevitsa
The mining waste dilution in the upper parts of the new 
push-back is higher than in deeper central parts of the 
pit  That has affected plans and the Mineral Reserve 
grades  Grades are down by approximately 10 percent  The 
uncertain permit situation for the tailing dam expansion 
has caused 20 Mtonnes to be converted back from reserve 
to resource  The Mineral Reserve has decreased with 19 
Mtonnes (19%) while the Mineral Resource increased with 25 
Mtonnes (17%)  9 8 Mtonnes were milled in 2023 
Tara
Tara was placed under care and maintenance in July 2023  
That also stopped all exploration towards Tara Deep  The 
existing Life of Mine Plan remains economically feasible 
with long term assumptions and Mineral Reserves are still 
declared for Tara  No new resource estimations have been 
made, and the reserves and resources are last year’s figures 
minus mining of 1 1 Mtonnes until operations stopped  
Preparatory work, including a new production plan, is 
underway for a possible restart in 2024

Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
About the classification
Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are estimated 
separately and divided into different categories  Conditions 
in the form of costs and metal prices are established at the 
beginning of the year and used in all estimations made 
during the year  Boliden’s Mineral Resources are exclusive of 
Mineral Reserves  When a Mineral Resource is converted to 
a Mineral Reserve, the quantity is removed from the Mineral 
Resource 
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of solid 
material of economic interest in or on the Earth’s crust in 
such form, grade or quality and quantity that there are
reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction  The 
location, quantity, grade or quality, continuity and other 
geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, 
estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence 
and knowledge, including sampling  Mineral Resources are 
subdivided in order of increasing geological confidence into 
Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories 
A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of 
a Measured Mineral Resource and or Indicated Mineral 
Resource  It includes diluting materials and allowances 
for losses, which may occur when the material is mined 
or extracted and is defined by studies at a Pre-Feasibility 
Study or Feasibility Study level, as appropriate, that include 
application of Modifying Factors  Such studies demonstrate 
that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably 
be justified 
Inferred Mineral Resource
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which quantity and grade or quality are 
estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and 
sampling  Geological evidence is sufficient to imply but 
not verify geological and grade or quality continuity  An 
Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence 
than that applying to an Indicated Mineral Resource and 
must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve  It is reasonably 
expected that the majority of Inferred Mineral Resources 
could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources with 
continued exploration 
Indicated Mineral Resource
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shape and physical characteristics are estimated with 
sufficient confidence to allow the application of Modifying 
Factors in sufficient detail to support mine planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the mineral deposit  
Geological evidence is derived from the adequately detailed 
and reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is suf- 
ficient to assume geological and grade or quality continu- 
ity between points of observation  An Indicated Mineral 
Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying 
to a Measured Mineral Resource and may only be converted 
to a Probable Mineral Reserve 
Measured Mineral Resource
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral 
Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shape, and physical characteristics are estimated with 
confidence sufficient to allow the application of Modifying 
Factors to support detailed mine planning and final eval- 
uation of the economic viability of the Mineral deposit 
Geological evidence is derived from the detailed and 
reliable exploration, sampling and testing and is sufficient to 
confirm geological and grade or quality continuity between 
points of observation  A Measured Mineral Resource has a 
higher level of confidence than that applying to either an 
Indicated Mineral Resource or an Inferred Mineral Resource  
A Measured Mineral Resource may be converted to a 
Proved Mineral Reserve or to a Probable Mineral Reserve 
Probable Mineral Reserve
A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable 
part of an Indicated Mineral Resource, and in some circum- 
stances, a Measured Mineral Resource  The confidence 
in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Mineral 
Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Mineral 
Reserve 
Proven Mineral Reserve
A Proven Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part 
of a Measured Mineral Resource  A Proven Mineral Reserve 
implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors

| Risk management
Boliden is exposed to various types of risks that could have 
a substantial impact on the Group  Work is performed 
continuously to reduce and monitor risks through effective 
risk management where all business units have imple-
mented processes to identify risks  As part of the risk work, 
a consolidated risk scenario is performed on an annual 
basis to identify and evaluate all risks within the Group  In 
the model below, the closer the identified risks are located 
to the center, the higher we assess the likelihood of their 
occurrence with a negative impact as a result on Boliden  
The tables on pages 54–57 describe the risks and how we

Risk Management 
Comments for the year
Health and safety
We handle large material flows both under and above 
ground, and from time to time our employees and con-
tractors are exposed to heavy machinery, lifting, high tem-
peratures and hazardous substances  Furthermore, many 
people work in shifts, which increases psychosocial risks  
Deviations from established procedures, inadequate 
­
planning and deficient resource assignment can create 
dangerous situations and increase the risk of injury 
In order to achieve our target of accident-free operations 
and healthy workplaces, we focus on pro-active risk 
reporting and learning from best practices both internally 
and externally, and we continue to work on strengthening 
our values-based behavior and culture  
Senior management and employees have participated 
in interactive training to better understand the impor-
tance of creating psychological safety at work  The aim 
of the training is to achieve a safe and healthy work-
place as well as to improve production and financial 
results  
Environmental impact
Our operations impact both the global climate and the local 
environment  For both operational and decommissioned 
sites, considerable risks can be linked to emissions to air and 
water, the storage of waste, energy consumption and the 
significance of land use that has an impact on biodiversity  
The risk is also linked to the increasing difficulty to get per-
mits for waste storage 
Boliden owns large land areas, which gives us the opportu-
nity to utilize the land areas to compensate for our impact on 
the use of land and related nature values  Hazardous waste 
streams are stored in safe repositories underground or in 
mountain caverns to minimize harm on the environment  For 
other waste streams we are looking at opportunities to pro-
duce products from current waste streams  Compliance with 
our emissions targets is closely monitored, and emissions 
generated by the operations are managed using the Best 
Available Technology and according to environmental per-
mits  Emergencies are prevented through continuous moni-
toring and systematic maintenance 
A new practical tool Climb was launched, for assessing 
nature in Sweden and the Nordic countries in a trans-
parent and comparable way  Climb has been develo-
ped together with Swedish industry and experts on 
biodiversity  It is now being tested at several sites and 
projects, for example for ecological compensation for 
recent land development in Aitik 
Tailings management and dam safety
Tailings facilities and their dam structures are a risk in the 
mining industry  In case of a dam failure there is potential for 
major consequences for humans and the environment  The 
integrity of our tailings facilities will be affected by extreme 
weather conditions and changes in precipitation  
The Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management is 
being implemented for all our tailings storage facilities  The 
system will ensure that we comply with our Tailings Gover-
nance Commitments in the following areas; roles, responsi-
bilities and competences, planning and resources, risk 
management, change management, emergency prepared-
ness and response, audit and review  As a member of ICMM 
(The International Council on Mining and Metals) we always 
implement the latest international guidelines regarding tail-
ings management and dam safety  
Process and product development to turn waste into 
valuable cement products with a low carbon footprint 
is ongoing 
Climate change
Climate change leads to global warming and more frequent 
and severe extreme weather events such as heatwaves, 
droughts, floods, heavy rain or snowfall and wildfires  
­
Related operational risks include damaged or destroyed 
facilities and infrastructure, and supply chain disruption  
Boliden has ambitious targets to further reduce our overall 
carbon footprint  We aim to fully integrate climate conside-
rations into decision-making processes and engage with 
stakeholders to communicate their commitment to climate 
resilience  The units evaluate their own weather-related ope-
rational risks and are responsible for conducting scenario 
analyses on the effects of the changing climate conditions in 
the relevant areas  
The new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Direc-
tive (CSRD) and its European Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ESRS) were published and finalized during 
the year  One of the standards, E1 Climate change is 
guding companies within the EU on, for example, how 
to report on its climate risks and opportunities  Boli-
den will start reporting accordingly from 2024 
onwards  
Unscheduled production stoppages
Our environmental performance and financial results can 
both suffer from unplanned production disruptions, for 
example due to technical problems, injuries, accidents or 
strikes  The pandemic years also demonstrated the risk of 
production disruptions due to societal restrictions and 
disturbances in our supply chains 
All Boliden units carry out preventive maintenance with the 
aim of minimizing the total cost for the Group  Major mainte-
nance shutdowns are carried out every year in the smelting 
operations, while maintenance work forms an integral part 
of day-to-day operations in mines  The risk of unscheduled 
production stoppages is also managed through continuous 
evaluation of the Group’s insurance solutions 
Skills supply
Competition for skilled labor is still increasing in many of the 
places where we operate, as a result of the industrial sector 
growth in those regions  Meanwhile, a major technology 
shift is taking place, with an increase in digitalization, pro-
cess development and automation, which risks leading to 
skills shortages in many different occupational groups 
We work continuously to attract new employees with the 
right skills to join Boliden, for example by communicating 
Boliden’s purpose, values and its role as an enabler of the cli-
mate transition  It is equally important to retain and develop 
current employees by systematically supporting career 
opportunities, providing development programs as well as 
working with people engagement  This is carried out both at 
the Group and unit levels within Boliden 
To be able to secure our future skills supply, we 
­
continue charting the need for skills linked to 
­
technological development during the year  We also 
further strengthened our collaborations within the 
industry, relevant universities, and other local stake-
holders  Joint efforts in promoting job opportunities 
increases incentives for people to relocate to the areas 
where we operate  The development of our 
Groupwide and local management and talent pro-
grams also continued  Focus areas were diversity and 
inclusion as well as people engagement  Efforts within 
these areas are important to further develop and 
retain ­
current employees 
Cyber risks
The risk of intrusion into the IT environment with 
ransomware or similar, which can bring IT systems to a halt, 
thus stopping production or other operations 
Since 2021, Boliden runs a program to systematically raise its 
security level  The program runs for three years and is based 
on the NIST framework, which includes identifying and pro-
tecting against intrusions, as well as detection, management 
and recovery in the event of an intrusion  The program 
addresses both administrative IT and production IT 
The general threat for cyber attacks remains high  The 
cybersecurity program that started in 2021 continues, 
and has improved Boliden’s capability to deal with this 
threat and increased the level of maturity in cyberse-
curity

Risk Management 
Comments for the year
Legal risks
Boliden’s operations are to a great extent subject to licensing and comprehensive regulation  Permits are reviewed regu-
larly  There is also a risk that we may be involved in commer-
cial or other legal proceedings 
Usually, our permits are renewed on multiple occasions 
during the lifespan of a mine, and also in the event of 
changes or an expansion of operations  We monitor legal 
developments in relevant fields, and we implement, follow 
up and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regula-
tions on an ongoing basis  Boliden is an active member of 
domestic and foreign trade organizations and works 
through these channels to spread knowledge about our 
industry and to ensure conditions appropriate for it  The 
Group is also a referral body for new rules, regulations and 
initiatives relating to the industry  Information on legal 
­
proceedings and disputes is provided in note 31 
During 2023 the long standing Apirsa litigation was 
subject to trial with respect to an EUR 89 9 m claim 
from the Junta de Andalucia for alleged cleanup costs  
Boliden won in the first instance but the ­
decision was 
appealed by the Junta de Andalucia  
Non-compliance risks
The Group may be exposed to legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial losses or damaged reputation as a result of any failure to follow applicable regulations 
The Group’s Ethics & Compliance function supports opera-
tions to ensure their compliance with internal policies and 
relevant external laws and regulations  Specific focus areas 
include Boliden’s Codes of Conduct for employees and busi-
ness partners, as well as handling cases reported through 
Boliden’s whistleblower system  Anti-corruption, trade 
­
sanctions, human rights, and combating money laundering 
and terrorist financing, the protection of personal data and 
compliance with competition law and regulations are other 
priority areas 
The focus on international sanctions has increased due 
to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  One identified risk is 
the sharing of common utilities with Norilsk Nickel, a 
Russian company, in the Harjavalta industrial area  The 
degree to which macroeconomic and political factors 
may affect Boliden is uncertain and presents a risk to 
its operations 
Risks harmful to confidence
Confidence in Boliden can be harmed by events such as 
serious incidents, or if employees or business partners 
fail to live up to business ethics and sustainability 
requirements 
Because we seek to be associated with ethical, sustainable 
business partners, we conduct systematic evaluations of and 
monitor customers and suppliers, both potential and exis-
ting, on the basis of criteria linked to business ethics and sus-
tainability  Before concluding ­
agreements, we review new 
business partners on a number of parameters  They are 
expected to adopt Boliden’s Code of Conduct for Business 
Partners or undertake to comply with other relevant and 
generally accepted business standards before agreements 
are concluded, and where necessary audits are carried out 
on suppliers’ premises to ensure ­
compliance  
Political risks
Political decisions may have effects on our operations  
Examples of such decisions include permit application 
­
processes for the mining industry 
Boliden and the trade associations in which we participate 
often act as referral bodies for upcoming political decisions 
that affect our operations, and this allows us to spread 
knowledge and information so that any decisions affecting 
us or our industry are appropriate and reasonable

Description of risk
Risk Management 
Comments for the year
Metal prices
Changes to metal prices are a significant risk for Boliden’s 
profit and cash flow 
Group policy is not to hedge metal prices, but rather to allow 
changes to be reflected in profits  However, we hedge smel-
ter metal price exposure of payable metals in the period 
between the purchase of raw material and the sale of the 
corresponding metal  
See note 28 for a sensitivity analysis 
Treatment charges
Treatment charges are determined by the supply and 
demand for metal concentrates, which represents a risk 
since they constitute a large part of the smelters’ gross profit 
Treatment charges are negotiated annually by the major 
players in the mining and smelting industries  These terms 
are applied to our internal purchases, and in most contracts 
with external metal concentrate suppliers 
 See note 28 for a sensitivity analysis 
Customers
We are dependent on a few large customers for part of our 
product portfolio, and reduced demand from industrial 
customers would increase the risk of sales via the London 
Metal Exchange, resulting in reduced margins 
We manage this risk through a diversified portfolio with 
long-term customer relationships and regard for exposure 
to different end-user segments  At the same time, there are 
plans in place to convert production to products suited to 
the London Metal Exchange, if necessary  
The risk is considered to have increased during the 
year as a result of the fire in Rönnskär and the adjust-
ment in the business model from selling cathodes to 
selling anodes  The sale of anodes relies on relatively 
few customers due to the technical nature of the pro-
duct  Anodes are not tradeable on the London Metal 
Exchange  
Credit risks in trade receivables
The risk that our customers fail to fulfill their obligations 
­
constitutes a credit risk 
Boliden manages credit risks in trade receivables through an 
established credit rating process, active credit monitoring, 
short credit periods and, in certain cases, credit insurance  
We have daily procedures for monitoring payments and we 
also constantly monitor the necessary provisions for expec-
ted credit losses 
The quality of trade receivables is deemed to be good 
and write-downs on outstanding receivables during 
the year occurred only in limited amounts  Further 
information provided in note 20 
Raw materials supply
A stable, reliable raw materials supply is needed to enable 
the smelters to produce at high levels of capacity utilization 
and consistent quality  The implementation of barriers to international trade in metal concentrates is a related risk 
We manage risks with raw materials supply through long-
term contracts and relationships with reliable external supp-
liers of metal concentrate and secondary materials, who also 
demonstrate high performance in sustainability  We engage 
with suppliers and collect information on their greenhouse 
gas emissions to promote reduction measures and to plan 
for possible changes in future trade flows  
During the year, the risk to our supply of raw materials 
is considered to have increased as a result of the 
potential implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border 
Adjustment Mechanism, which would increase the 
cost of raw material purchases from outside the EU 
Supply of goods and services
Our operations depend on an ongoing supply of equipment, consumables and services, and as a consequence, sensitivity to disruptions in suppliers’ production and supply chains is a 
risk for Boliden 
We work actively to reduce price and supply risks by having multiple qualified suppliers in each category and area  In 
cases where there is only one supplier, we reduce the risk 
through buffer stocks and by identifying alternative supply 
solutions  In this regard, the organization’s ability to adapt 
rapidly has been a success factor 
Supply chain risks have during the year mainly cente-
red around inflation and Boliden’s ability to source 
products and services at price and cost levels that 
make sense for the business  Chemicals have been the 
most troublesome area and lots of effort has been put 
into finding alternative sources to secure the most cost 
­
efficient supply possible 
Energy prices
Because energy accounts for around 17 percent of operating costs, changes in energy prices constitute a significant risk 
for our financial performance 
In Norway, Odda has a long-term electricity agreement with 
inflation adjusted pricing clauses  The contract portfolios in 
Sweden, Finland and Ireland have shorter terms and the Group 
is partly more exposed to market prices, which has had a nega-
tive impact on the operating profit  We anticipate continued 
high price volatility in the electricity market, which is partly 
managed through longer electricity contracts, activated in 
2023 and 2024, in Sweden and Finland  At the same time, we 
analyze opportunities for long-term contracts on an ongoing 
basis 
Due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine there is still instabi-
lity in the European gas market

Operations
Description of risk
Risk Management 
Comments for the year
Exchange rate and metal price risks
Pricing terms for products are based mainly on metal exchanges, and ours are priced largely in USD  As a result, transaction exposure arises from binding undertakings to 
our customers and suppliers, where the cost of raw materials 
and exchange rates may differ from the final sales value, or in 
fixed price offers made in different currencies long before 
delivery  Changes in exchange rates and prices have a major 
impact on Boliden’s profit and cash flow  
Transaction exposure in conjunction with binding underta-
kings are hedged while the smelters’ process inventories are 
not hedged  Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge the sales price and exchange rate when purchasing 
input raw material, or in fixed price sales agreements  We 
make constant calculations concerning the way in which 
changes in metal and exchange rate markets affect Boliden’s 
financial position  For major investments the Group may 
enter into contracts to hedge forecasted sales from metal 
price and currencies  Future investment payments in curren-
cies other than the local currency may be hedged under cer-
tain defined circumstances  See note 27 and the sensitivity 
analysis in note 28 
The risk is considered to have remained fairly constant 
during the year even as we have seen large fluctua-
tions in exchange rates, interest rates and metal prices  
Currency risk in translation exposure
A translation difference arises when converting net invest-
ments in overseas operations into SEK in conjunction with exchange rate fluctuations, which risks impacting Other comprehensive income negatively within the Group 
Under our finance policy, we do not actively eliminate the 
effect of translation exposure through equity hedging  
However, if an external borrowing requirement exists, the 
liability in foreign currency is used as equity hedge against 
the foreign asset pool  The main borrowing currencies are 
SEK and EUR  
Interest rate risk
Changes in market interest rates affect profits and cash flows 
Our finance policy allows an average fixed interest term of 
up to four years  Further information provided in note 29 
The Group’s loan portfolio had an average fixed inte-
rest term of 1 1 years (1 7)  Interest rate swaps are used 
to extend the fixed interest term 
Refinancing and liquidity risk
The risk that Boliden will be unable to obtain the requisite financing or meet its payment obligations due to insuffi-
cient  liquidity 
We limit refinancing risk through diversification of counter-
parties, financing sources and maturities, and through good 
governance to ensure compliance with loan agreement 
terms  Current liquidity is available in the form of unutilized 
credit facilities, and is reviewed regularly 
The average term of total loan limits was 3 3 years (3 4) 
at year-end, and net payment capacity totaled SEK 
14,843 m (23,005)  
The risk is considered to have remained fairly 
constant during the year as banks in general have kept 
a neutral risk appetite 
Credit risks and financial operations
Credit and counterparty risk refers to the risk that a counter-
party in a transaction may fail to fulfill their obligation, thus 
causing the Group to incur a loss  
Our finance policy mandates a Standard & Poor’s credit 
rating of minimum “A” for financial counterparties when 
entering into new transactions, and sets a maximum deposit 
of cash and cash equivalents per counterparty 
Credit quality and the counterparty diversification for 
derivatives were considered to have been good in 
2023, and at year-end the credit risk in external deriva-
tive instruments had a market value of SEK 366 m (415) 
Financial reporting
Inaccurate financial and operational reporting poses a risk to the Group 
The Group has a well functioning internal control structure  
There are control functions at the local unit level, as well as at 
the business area and head office levels, and all of these 
work within a common financial reporting framework  
We carry out annual controls of the framework  Impairment 
test on assets are completed annually and when indicators 
arise, to ensure that assets are recoverable 
During 2023 risk workshops have been performed on 
all sites to ensure that financial reporting risks are 
­
properly addressed and controlled  For further infor-
mation regarding impairment test see note 14

Market | Developments on the metal markets 
Developments on 
the metal markets
fossil fuels increased worldwide  Major metal intensive investments will 
be necessary for electricity generation, power distribution infrastructure 
and electrical equipment  Global demand for base metals is expected to 
grow for a long time  
Long-term metal supply
Mines have limited lifespans and must be replaced by new ones, but 
this will only occur if mining companies believe future metal prices will 
yield profitable investments in new projects  The trend of increasingly 
comprehensive requirements from permit-issuing authorities and local 
communities, the larger scale of projects due to lower metal grades, and 
a growing need for infrastructure have gradually increased cost levels 
and capital intensity in the mining industry  Due to the above factors, 
developing a new mine usually takes many years, and the time from 
discovery to metal production is increasing  In current circumstances this 
could lead to future supply shortages for most of our main metals  While 
expansion in existing mines generally has lower capital intensity, it will 
only partially meet the future demand for metals  The smelting capacity 
expansion rate is based on the view companies have of demand in the 
regional market and the supply of raw materials  New capacity affects 
concentrate market balance and thus the terms between smelters and 
the mines  Metal recycling rates are expected to increase over time, but 
as with the expansion of existing mines, they are only able to meet part 
of the future demand for metals  
China’s dominant position 
China accounts for about 40–50 percent of global base metal demand 
and significant shares of the world’s metal supply  Economic devel-
opment in the country is therefore of great importance for Boliden’s 
markets  China’s economy is expected to become more focused on 
services and less on infrastructure and real estate development, leading 
to lower future metal demand  At the same time, economic growth is 
expected to decline gradually  Smelting capacity expansion in China has 
developed at a fast pace in order to meet the rapid growth in demand 
for base metals  Metal imports are significant, and the Chinese smelting 
industry has become a major player in the global concentrate market, 
especially for copper  While China’s position as the world’s largest nickel 
producer was recently taken over by Indonesia, this was through major 
investments controlled by Chinese interests  Global copper and zinc 
mining capacity has sometimes been a limiting factor when investment 
growth was high in China  Even during periods of slowdown in global 
economic activity or when extraordinary situations have affected the 
economy, demand from China continued to be good, and therefore 
periods of low copper and zinc prices were brief from a historical 
perspective 
Market trends
The global economy showed resilience during 2023 amid a challenging 
macroeconomic backdrop with monetary tightening, volatile energy 
markets and increased geopolitical tensions  Global growth was stronger 
than anticipated and GDP increased by 2 6 percent  Inflation had already 
begun to fall in the beginning of the year as a response to the US Federal 
Reserve initiating interest rate hikes in 2022, followed by the European 
Central Bank and others  As central banks continued to increase interest 
rates, inflation kept falling in most of the major economies  Towards the 
end of the year, expectations of rate cuts in the near future had a positive 
effect on market sentiment, which also gave strong support to metal 
prices such as copper and gold  Geopolitical risks increased during the 
year as the war in Ukraine continued and the Israel-Hamas war broke 
out in October  Price spikes and supply disruptions closely linked to the 
war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia eased, including for 
energy, metals, and food items  Energy prices continued to be volatile, 
but to a lesser extent than in the previous year  The risks associated with 
the Covid-19 pandemic as a major global threat diminished  
The global stock market rebounded from the negative performance of 
2022  Especially the US stock market showed strong growth, partially 
driven by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and the technology 
companies involved in its development  The growth in European stock 
indexes was more moderate and the discount to American companies 
were at historical highs  In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, 
which offers tax credits and other incentives to promote investment, 
started to shape the renewable energy market in a significant way, with 
the US as the preferred destination, including investments in the supply 
chain of critical metals  The urgency to limit climate change increased 
and faster progress will be required to meet the 2030 target set by 
the Paris Agreement and net zero by 2050  At the UN Climate Change 
Conference (COP28), almost 200 countries pledged to move away from 
fossil fuels and triple new investments in renewable energy  
Price developments in the metals market were generally weak in 2023  
Both supply and demand for base metals increased and most markets 
were in surplus  With supply chains returning to more normal conditions 
and falling prices of raw materials, including metals, industrial destocking 
of inventories put further pressure on demand and prices 
Long-term metal demand
Historically, increased metal demand has been strongly linked to global 
economic growth and especially to developments in China, which 
accounted for the single largest source of demand for base metals  
Although growth over the long term is expected to decline both globally 
and in China, metal demand will increase sharply thanks to climate 
transition and the electrification of societies  Ambitions to phase out 
Despite monetary tightening, volatile energy markets, 
and increased geopolitical tensions, the global 
economy remained resilient, however, the base metals 
markets experienced weak developments 
Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023

Weak demand
Global demand for zinc developed poorly in 2023, 
particularly in Europe, where it declined by 10 percent  
Compared to the previous year, global demand 
remained unchanged  Activity in the construction 
sector was severely affected by high interest rates 
which reduced demand for housing  However, demand 
from the automotive industry was more robust  
Although Germany, Europe’s largest market, experi-
enced a strong increase in produced units, production 
remained below pre-Covid-19 levels  Consumers, still 
mindful of the previous year’s energy crisis, remained 
cautious  Zinc prices developed very poorly in 2023 
and fell by an average of 24 percent during the year 
despite significant supply adjustments in the mining 
sector  
Return of smelter production
During the energy crisis of 2022, many smelters 
temporarily reduced production rates or shut down 
operations completely, particularly in Europe  The zinc 
smelter industry, being energy-intensive, is vulnerable 
to high energy prices  As energy markets normalized 
in 2023, zinc production also stabilized, though some 
smelter disruptions remained  Global production 
increased by 3 percent  LME inventories reached the 
highest level since 2021 and metal premiums fell  Spot 
market premiums were at historically high levels in 
the beginning of the year but nearly halved over the 
Steady demand and price development 
Demand for copper grew by 2 percent compared to the 
previous year, despite the macroeconomic headwinds  
While demand in Europe was weak, it was more than 
offset by strong demand in China, where consumption 
increased by 6 percent  Copper continued to benefit 
from the trend toward increased electrification, battery 
charging and power transmission infrastructure, along 
with the supply-side issues  On average, the copper price 
fell by 4 percent during 2023, which was significantly less 
than many other base metals  
Stable smelter production
Global production of finished copper metal increased 
by 4 percent in 2023, primarily led by China where pro-
duction increased by 9 percent with the start-up of new 
smelter capacity  Global stock levels slightly decreased 
during the year and remained at low levels  Metal premi-
ums increased in Europe but fell in Asian markets  
Lower mined production than anticipated
The supply of concentrates increased by 5 percent in 
2023 but fell short of expectations as many mining 
companies failed to deliver on guided volumes  
Significant disruptions in key operations in Latin America 
contributed to this shortfall  Spot market treatment 
charges increased during most of 2023 but fell sharply 
The zinc market
The copper market
course of the year 
Suspended mine production
Global mine production decreased by 3 percent 
during the year  Several mines became unprofitable 
due to weaker zinc prices and were put on care and 
maintenance  In the beginning of the year the concern 
was smelter availability, which resulted in improved 
terms for smelters, with the negotiated treatment 
charges in benchmark annual contracts set at USD 274 
(230) per tonne concentrate, including some positive 
price participation  However, the market balance 
towards the end of the year upon the news of reduced 
concentrate supply  Benchmark annual contracts at USD 
88/8 8 USc were above spot terms  Annual contracts for 
2024 were established at USD 80/8 0 USc  Production 
costs for mining companies continued to increase during 
the year from the higher base in 2022  Costs for power 
and fuel decreased but other items such as labor and 
consumables increased  Costs were also increased due 
to the effect of higher treatment charges and lower rev-
enues from by-products  Cash cost in the 90th percentile

| Developments on the metal markets 
Slower growth in demand
In 2023, demand for nickel increased by 6 percent 
compared to 2022  Stainless steel, representing almost 
two-thirds of global demand, saw a 6 percent increase 
in nickel consumption  Batteries, the second largest 
market for nickel consumption, grew by 9 percent, 
significantly lower compared to recent years  China, 
the world’s leading battery market, only increased the 
consumption of nickel by 5 percent despite significant 
growth in electric vehicle sales globally  Falling prices 
for battery raw materials, including nickel, lithium and 
cobalt, led to widespread destocking throughout the 
supply chain 
Falling nickel price
The average LME price of nickel decreased by 16 
percent in 2023 as it fell from the high levels in 2022  
From the start to end of the year, the price fell by 45 
percent  Despite the decrease, LME prices traded at 
a significant premium to class 2 nickel products such 
as nickel pig iron (NPI) and ferronickel, although the 
differential narrowed 
Continued expansion in Indonesia
The global production of nickel increased in 2023 as 
capacity additions were continuously brought online 
in Indonesia  The country has the biggest ore reserves 
in the world and is currently the largest nickel producer 
following major investments to develop the domestic 
nickel supply chain  Nickel production increased by 
Stable demand and supply
Global lead demand increased by 1 percent compared 
to the previous year  The supply of lead metal also 
increased by 3 percent as smelter production normal-
ized following disturbances related to high energy 
costs in the previous year  Both primary and secondary 
lead smelters increased output levels  The price of lead 
is typically quite stable compared to other base metals, 
and in 2023 it fell by 1 percent, despite a weaker dollar  
The nickel market
The lead market
10 percent globally compared to 2022  Indonesia 
and China, the two leading producers, increased 
production by 22 percent and 16 percent, respectively  
Both segments of the nickel market, class 1 and class

Gold and silver prices are governed by anticipated 
developments in the global economy and have often 
been sought-after metals in weak economic conditions 
or when unusual events affect the global economy  
Precious metals are included in the investment 
portfolios of financial players to an increasing extent  
Following a historical high level of gold purchases by 
central banks in 2022, gold continued to be bought 
in large volumes in 2023  Interest among financial 
investors declined during the year, most notably in 
Europe, with significant funds outflows  The gold 
price had a strong second half of 2023 driven by the 
increased geopolitical risk as the Israel-Hamas war

and large parts of the industry struggled with marginal 
profitability or loss-making at prices recorded at the 
end of the year 
LME stocks of finished metal in Asian warehouses grew 
throughout most of the year but remained essentially 
zero in Europe  Mine production was unchanged, 
partially affected by the suspension of production 
at several zinc mines around the world where lead 
is produced as a by-product  Treatment charges in 
benchmark annual contracts decreased from 2022 but 
were higher than those observed on the spot market 
broke out as well as the growing expectations that 
the US Federal Reserve could start the rate cutting 
cycle soon  The average price increased by 8 percent 
compared to 2022  The silver price followed the same 
pattern, although the metal is more dependent on the 
economic cycle, as a significant proportion of demand 
is industrial  The silver price increased by 7 percent in 
2023  The price of palladium fell by 37 percent during 
2023 as automotive OEMs reduced inventories  The 
price of platinum managed to remain flat given weak 
global mine production and substitution of palladium 
in the lower-temperature part of autocatalysts

The USD saw a mixed development against other 
currencies during the year following the strong 
development in 2022 due to the US Federal Reserve’s 
early decision to carry out aggressive interest rate 
hikes  As other central banks caught up in the cycle of 
raising interest rates throughout the year, the relative 
strength of the USD faded  However, global economic 
uncertainty and increased geopolitical tensions ben-
efited the USD, which is perceived as less risky given it 
is the world’s largest currency  The USD exchange rate 
increased by 5 percent against the SEK and fell by 3 
percent against the EUR

About pricing
Metals
Prices for copper, zinc, nickel and lead are set 
daily on the London Metal Exchange (LME)  In 
addition to the price, there is usually a premium  
Its level is governed by the local balance 
between metal demand, smelter capacity, 
shipping costs and payment terms  Prices for 
gold, silver, palladium and platinum are set in 
a similar way by the London Bullion Market 
Association (LBMA)  Cobalt and tellurium prices 
are published in the Metal Bulletin  
Concentrates
The price of concentrate is usually the LME 
price less treatment charges and is calculated 
on the payable part of a concentrate’s metal 
content, and regulated by terms and condi-
tions between mines and smelters  The balance 
between the supply of concentrates from the 
world’s mines and smelter demand governs 
pricing between mines and smelters

Since the acquisition of the Kevitsa mine, Boliden enjoys the same 
integrated structure in nickel as it does in copper and zinc, with the 
exception that Boliden does not produce finished nickel metal but 
an intermediate product known as nickel matte, which is sold on for 
further processing  Harjavalta is the only nickel smelter in Western 
Europe 
Mining and smelting companies – nickel
Boliden is an important lead mining company globally, but without a 
primary lead mine  Instead, lead is extracted as a by-product, mainly 
from the zinc mines  Boliden is a medium-sized smelter for primary 
lead and has a significant position in lead recycling in Europe 
through the Bergsöe smelter 
Mining and smelting companies – lead
Boliden is the world’s eighth largest zinc mining company measured 
on 2023 production, which takes into account the curtailment of 
production at Tara mid-year  Garpenberg and Tara, when fully operational, are major zinc mines by international comparison, and Garpenberg is also one of Europe’s biggest producers of silver  
The Boliden Area is a minor zinc producer

CASH MARGIN FOR THE SMELTER INDUSTRY
CASH COST FOR THE MINING INDUSTRY
well-known to ­
the market thanks to the regular ­
compilation 
by independent analysts, such as Wood Mackenzie¹), of 
information on cost levels, known as cash cost  Highly com-
petitive mines often have high grades, significant revenues 
from by-products, advantageous infrastructure, and low 
costs  Smelter competitiveness is usually compared using 
the cash margin metric, which is a more comparable metric, 
since smelters extract multiple metals and by-products  
Smelter competitiveness depends on the cost level, stable 
processes with ability to recover and extract other metals 
and by-products in addition to the primary metal 
Aitik has the world’s highest productivity for open pit mines with 
concentrator according to Wood Mackenzie  Kevitsa is a nickel and 
copper mine with by-products  Kevitsa is in the first quartile on the 
nickel cash cost curve 
Garpenberg and the Boliden Area have large revenues from 
multiple metals and report according to pro rata costing  
Tara reports according to normal costing  According to Wood 
Mackenzie, Garpenberg has world-leading productivity among 
underground mines 
Boliden’s copper smelters enjoy a high cash margin due to 
its ability to process complex materials  In 2023, Rönnskär’s 
position was negatively affected by the fire in the tank 
house  Harjavalta has significant revenues from its nickel 
business 
Boliden’s zinc smelters benefit from economies of scale and low 
energy costs, but have low production of by-products  The cash 
margin curve is relatively flat and there is little difference between 
the smelters at lower and higher percentiles

Competitiveness
Metals are traded and priced on global exchanges  
Competitive costs and sustainable processes are critical to 
long-term success as the metals are largely produced and 
traded in their pure forms without distinguishing properties  
Boliden’s operations are sustainable and competitive thanks 
to leading-edge technological capabilities, high productiv-
ity, cost-effiency and a limited environmental footprint 
Unlike refined metals, mined concentrates are not traded on 
exchanges, but are priced by leading players who announce 
their terms in the form of annual ­
agreements known as 
benchmark contracts  Unit production costs for mines are

ordinary general meetings  Shareholders may request 
to add an item to the agenda of the AGM by sending a written 
request to the Board in due time before the issue of the notice 
for the AGM  Shareholders are also welcome to submit inquiries 
on company matters to the Board, the President and CEO, the 
auditor or the Remuneration or Audit Committees 
The AGM is the highest corporate decision-making body  The 
resolutions of the AGM include election of members of the 
Board, Chairman of the Board and Nomination Committee, 
the adoption of the income statement and balance sheet, ap-
propriation of earnings and release from liability for members 
of the Board and the CEO, the approval of fees to members 
of the Board and auditors, and the approval of principles for 
remuneration of the CEO and other senior executives  Where 
applicable, the AGM also passes resolutions on changes to the 
articles of association and the election of auditors  AGMs are 
usually held at one of Boliden’s sites in Sweden combined with 
the possibility to participate through postal voting  In conjunc-
tion with the meetings, the shareholders have the opportunity 
to participate in guided tours in Boliden’s mines, concentrators 
or smelters to gain a deeper understanding of the operations 
and have an opportunity to meet Boliden’s employees  The 
2023 AGM was held in Garpenberg; see page 77

Corporate Governance
Boliden has enjoyed a number of very successful and 
prosperous years, but 2023 entailed a shift with several 
challenges  How has this affected your role as Chairman 
and for the work of the Board of Directors?
“The metal and mining industry is volatile by its nature, and 
fluctuations in the base metal prices and currencies have a 
significant impact on us  In addition to global economic factors, 
Boliden has also had some internal events to tackle during 
2023, most importantly the fire at Rönnskär’s tank house, 
Tara being placed under care and maintenance and various 
operational issues related to production  These incidents have 
profoundly affected not only our business but also our people  
Fortunately, Boliden’s strong brand and firm financial position 
combined with our dedicated workforce and history of high 
performance provide a solid foundation for overcoming diffi-
culties that arise from time to time  Part of my role as Chairman 
is to focus on our strengths and provide motivation, support 
and guidance to the rest of the Board, the CEO and President 
and the management team in their continued work particu-
larly in challenging circumstances  This has necessitated more 
frequent board meetings, reassessment and affirmation of our 
strategic direction and continuous oversight to ensure we make 
appropriate decisions and progress in the right direction  
It is vital that we continue to be guided by our core values  We 
must care for our employees to ensure they feel supported 
during challenges, we should demonstrate the courage to take 
difficult decisions when needed, and we take responsibility 
to our stakeholders in continuing to be a reliable and strong 
business partner  Apart from support in navigating challenges, 
my role and the role of the Board of Directors is also to help 
positioning Boliden for the future by evaluating new opportu-
nities, innovations and future technologies  
As always sustainability remains a key focus for the Board  
Boliden is one of the first mining and smelting companies 
that has been validated by SBTi  We are also preparing for the 
implementation of the new CSRD reporting standards across 
Europe  All in all, over the longer term, I am confident that 
Boliden is well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand 
for our metals, driven by the transition to a green economy and 
a heightened focus on European production ”
On the back of his second year as Chairman of the Board, 
Karl-Henrik Sundström, reflects on board work during more 
challenging times

In 2023, 43 percent of the Board members elected by the AGM 
were women  The ambition is to maintain an even gender 
distribution as well as an appropriate Board composition fit for 
purpose and meeting the company’s requirements  The Nom-
ination Committee has not yet completed its work for the 2024 
AGM when this Annual and Sustainability Report is released 
for publication  The Nomination Committee’s proposals will be 
submitted in its motivated statement, which will be published 
in the notice of attendance to the AGM and on our company 
website 
The Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors is appointed by the shareholders and is 
ultimately responsible for the company’s organization and the 
management of the company’s affairs in the best interests of 
both Boliden and its shareholders  Under the provisions of the 
articles of association, the Board of Directors must comprise a 
minimum of three and a maximum of ten members, excluding 
deputies, elected by the AGM  Employees have a statutory 
right to appoint three members and three deputies to the 
Board 
Since the AGM of 2023, the Board, which is elected for one year 
at a time, has comprised seven members elected by the AGM 
and three members appointed by the trade union organi-
zations  Board meetings are attended both by the ordinary 
members and by the deputies  The President and CEO and the 
CFO are the Group management members who usually attend  
Other members of Group management and other executives 
also attend and present reports on specialist issues as required  
The General Counsel, Group Legal Affairs, is the Secretary of 
the Board 
The Board members elected by the AGM are all independent 
in relation to major shareholders, the company and Group 
management  Thus the Board complies with the requirements 
of the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance with regard 
to independent members  The members of the Board are 
presented on pages 74 and 75 and on our company website  
The Board sets the company’s financial targets and strategy, 
appoints and evaluates the President and CEO  It ensures that 
efficient systems are in place for monitoring and controlling 
operations, that statutory and regulatory requirements are 
complied with and that information is published in a correct 
and transparent manner  At the statutory board meeting held 
every year immediately after the AGM, the Board adopts rules 
of procedure that govern its work and responsibilities in more 
detail  The allocation of duties between the Board and the 
President and CEO is set out in the instructions to the Presi-
dent and CEO adopted by the Board at the statutory board 
meeting 
The Chairman supervises the Board’s work and ensures an 
open, constructive dialogue  The Chairman’s duties also 
include monitoring and evaluating the expertise and work of 
individual Board members and their contribution to the Board  
The Board and its work are evaluated annually and the results 
of the evaluation are conveyed to the Nomination Committee  
The evaluation is carried out by the Board under the super-
vision of the Chairman or with the help of an independent 
consultant  The 2023 evaluation was conducted by using an 
established Board evaluation platform (BoardClick) in which 
the members answered questions on a range of different top-
ics concerning the Board’s work  This also gave an opportunity 
for the members of the Board to express what they would like 
to learn more about to develop in their assignments  
An important part of the Chairman’s work is to act as an inter-
locutor and support for the President and CEO and to make 
sure that the Board’s decisions, instructions and directives are 
complied with and carried out  Prior to every Board meet-
ing, the Chairman and the President and CEO prepare and 
review the agenda items for the respective Board meeting  
Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023

Corporate Governance
Documentation in the form of memorandums on the topics on 
the agenda is sent to Board members one week ahead of each 
Board meeting and followed up by supporting slides and oral 
presentations at the Board meetings  
The work of the Board in 2023
The Board held 14 meetings in 2023, including the statutory 
board meeting and 7 extra board meetings  The unusually 
large number of extra Board meetings in 2023 was partly due 
to the introduction of a long-term incentive program and, 
more importantly, by the events relating to the fire at the 
Rönnskär smelter and some other significant events requiring 
board assessment or decisions  The Board receives information 
on a continuous basis through monthly reports tracking the 
company’s performance with respect to safety, sustainability, 
and results  In addition to the monthly reports, the Board is 
provided with detailed information on the company’s devel-
opment at each Board meeting  Every regular meeting begins 
with a review of the operations of both business areas including 
production, sales, projects and investments, macro data 
outlook and industry trends, metal prices, treatment charges, 
demand for the company’s products, financial performance, 
rules and regulations affecting the company, possible chal-
lenges or risks that have been identified, and other relevant 
topics from time to time  In addition to these recurring topics, 
there are also a number of thematic items that are decided by 
the Board at the beginning of each year to highlight specific 
areas where the Board wishes to have special focus or to gain 
deeper knowledge 
Given the nature of the operations, an important part of the 
Board’s focus at each meeting is sustainability related topics 
and metrics such as the development of lost time injuries (work 
related accidents) and sick leave, emission levels and targets, 
permit and license to operate issues  In addition to recurrent 
follow-ups, these issues are also the subject of discussions and 
considerations linked to specific projects or investments and 
recurring in-depth studies  
In 2023, we continued our efforts to achieve our vision of 
becoming the most climate-friendly and respected metal 
provider in the world, and sustainability related initiatives and 
decisions were high on the agenda of the Board and manage-
ment  The issues that were in focus during the year included 
expanding and building on our green metals portfolio, 
transforming iron silicate into cement products, biodiversi-
ty, indigenous people and communities, sustainable waste 
management, emissions, the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), as well as continued work and investments in dam safety 
in particular at our Aitik mine 
In general, all of our operations are subject to permits  Permit 
application processes in recent years have become more 
complex, protracted and difficult to predict with appeals at 
several levels  Issues concerning important permits and license 
to operate on acceptable terms are the subject of ongoing 
information to the Board for discussion 
We also monitor the general trends and developments in the 
sustainability field to ensure the best possible conditions for 
mining and smelting industries  We have been promoting an 
awareness that our metals, in particular copper and nickel, are 
essential for the green transition and that responsible mining 
activities can be carried out in Natura 2000 areas  Advocacy 
programs are pursued mainly through the European industry 
associations Eurometaux and Euromines, and with the help 
of domestic industry associations such as Svemin  The Board 
is informed on an ongoing basis about relevant national and 
international initiatives and proposed rules and regulations in 
the field of sustainability that may affect or be relevant for our 
operations  These initiatives or rules are presented to the Board 
by means of in-depth analyses to promote better understand-
ing and knowledge, and thereby well-informed decisions  The 
sustainability related topics that were subject to these in-depth 
presentations in 2023 related to dam safety, Green Transition 
Metals, biodiversity and the management of slag and waste, as 
shown in the table illustrating this year’s Board meetings  
Due to the fire at our Rönnskär smelter, the Board further 
increased its focus on risk management and contingency 
planning in 2023  
Board committees
The overall responsibility of the Board cannot be delegated  
However, the Board may set up internal committees to address 
issues in defined areas  Thus, as in previous years, the Board 
set up an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee  
Committee members are appointed at the statutory Board 
meeting held after the AGM  Their work is governed by the 
committees’ rules of procedure and instructions  
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee prepares certain accounting and fi-
nance-related issues for consideration by the Board and there-
by supports the Board in the fulfillment of its responsibilities 
within the areas of internal control and confirming the quality 
of financial reporting  The company has an internal control de-
partment that works with identifying and following up on risk 
areas  The Audit Committee also monitors the procurement of 
services from the company’s auditors in addition to the audit 
and where necessary it submits proposals to the Nomination 
Committee regarding the election of auditors  As of 2023, the 
Audit Committee has also been engaged in monitoring the 
company’s work with implementation of the CSRD report-
ing standards  The committee meets prior to each quarterly 
financial report and also as necessary  The Audit Committee 
comprises Pia Rudengren (Chair), Karl-Henrik Sundström and 
Tomas Eliasson 
The committee members have specialist competence, expe-
rience of and interest in financial and accounting issues; see 
Board assignments and previous positions, pages 74 and 75  
The committee’s meetings are also attended by the Group’s 
Executive Vice President and CFO and the Head of Internal 
Control  The committee held five meetings in 2023  During the 
year, special attention was paid to internal controls, environ-
mental reclamation-related accounting matters and IT secu-
rity  The Audit Committee works according to the instructions 
for the Audit Committee adopted annually, and it reports the 
outcome of its work to the Board on an ongoing basis 
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee submits proposals for resolu-
tion to the Board regarding remuneration and other terms of 
employment for the President and CEO, and follows up on and 
evaluates programs for variable remuneration for the Group 
management team  The committee also approves proposals 
regarding salaries and other terms of employment for Group 
management, as proposed by the President and CEO  Also, 
the Remuneration Committee draws up proposals regarding 
remuneration principles for the President and CEO and the 
Group management for subsequent submission by the Board 
to the AGM for resolution  The application of the guidelines 
and relevant remuneration structures and levels in the com-
pany are also followed up by the committee, and the results of 
this evaluation are published on the company website  During 
2023, the Remuneration Committee initiated the work to set 
up a long-term share-based incentive program for a smaller

group of senior employees  The suggestion to set up such a 
program was approved by the Annual General Meeting of 
shareholders  See note 5 for an account of the remuneration 
paid to Group management 
The Remuneration Committee works according to the instruc-
tions for the Remuneration Committee adopted annually, and 
it reports the results of its work to the Board  Following the 
statutory meeting in April, the Remuneration Committee com-
prises Karl-Henrik Sundström (Chair) and Per Lindberg  During 
the year, the committee held six meetings, which is more than 
during a normal committee year, related to the development 
and launch of the new Long Term Incentive Program 
The President and CEO and the Group ­
management
The President and CEO has the ultimate responsibility for 
Boliden’s day-to-day business, strategic direction, compliance 
with and implementation of the Board’s decisions, and for 
ensuring that risk management, control systems, organization 
and processes are all satisfactory  The President and CEO 
is supported in his work by the Group’s management team 
which, in addition to the President and CEO, comprises the 
presidents of Boliden’s two business areas, Mines and Smelters, 
the CFO, and the Executive Vice President People and Sustain-
ability  Group management meets at least once a month to 
follow up on operations and discuss groupwide issues, draw 
up proposals for strategic plans, business plans and budgets, 
which the President and CEO then presents to the Board for 
consideration 
Group management meets once a year to discuss strategy 
planning  Group management and the management of the 
respective business areas also meet four times a year to review 
business area specific issues, including a review of budgets and 
operations  For large-scale projects, special steering groups 
are formed, which regularly meet with project managers and 
other stakeholders  Furthermore, the President and CEO and 
Executive Vice President People and Sustainability meet with 
the company’s employee representative Board members and 
deputies before every Board meeting, to discuss the agenda 
and other issues of current interest  See page 76 for a presen-
tation of the Group management team 
Business management
The President and CEO is together with his or her Group man-
agement team responsible for implementing the decisions of 
the Board of Directors  This is done by delegation of duties to 
the operating units  These delegation frameworks are defined 
in Boliden’s policy documents, budget and strategic plan  The 
policy documents are available on the internal management 
system and include the Code of Conduct and a number of pol-
icies, including financial, tax, anti-corruption, competition law, 
market abuse/insiders, sanctions and anti-money laundering, 
whistleblowing, delegation and decision making, third party 
due diligence and the Business Partner Code of Conduct, com-
munications, privacy and personal data management (GDPR), 
and a wide range of environmental, health and safety related 
policy documents 
Sustainability governance
Boliden’s sustainability work is based on the topics that are 
most important for the operations  These topics are managed 
by the Board through the President and CEO and Group 
management to the operational units  The Executive Vice 
President People and Sustainability, who is a member of Group 
management, is dedicated to topics that are related to People 
and Sustainability  The day-to-day responsibility for sustain-
ability matters is decentralized to the respective units  Group 
functions in People and Sustainability (Sustainability Control, 
HR, Health and Safety, Ethics and Compliance, Communica-
tions, Environment and Quality) are responsible for develop-
ing structure and direction for the work, monitoring trends, 
promoting best practice sharing and coordinating the work in 
the units  They report to the Executive Vice President People 
and Sustainability 
Sustainability topics are followed up and discussed at all Group 
management meetings, Board meetings and local manage-
ment meetings  The most important sustainability topics are 
integrated into our strategy  Every sustainability topic has a 
long-term direction that guides and structures the work at 
every level in the company  Priorities are based on applicable 
regulations and the terms and conditions in our operating 
licenses but also the impact our operations have on people, 
the environment and society, expectations from internal and 
external stakeholders, risks and opportunities and relevant 
external trends  Boliden has committed to the UN Global Com-
pact, UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the principles 
of International Council on Metals and Mining (ICMM) 
We also support Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) and we have a management system 
that complies with the ISO standards for the environment, 
quality, energy and occupational health and safety  Important 
sustainability topics are also covered through participation in 
European and national industry organizations  As prioritized 
challenges and opportunities change over time, materiality 
assessments are held regularly, usually once a year, in which 
representatives from the business units and Group functions 
are involved 
Sustainability is integrated in the strategy work, and each 
business area is responsible for setting local targets based on 
the Group’s sustainability guidelines  Our sustainability work is 
value based, which means that action plans are not only deter-
mined based on legislation and regulatory requirements, but 
also on needs and identified activities that can improve the sit-
uation for people, the environment and our local communities  
This means that investments with major environmental or safe-
ty benefits in relation to the amount invested are implemented 
independently of external requirements or obligations 
Boliden’s Sustainable Finance Committee (SFC) was es-
tablished in 2022 with the purpose to further integrate our 
sustainability and financing, and to ensure transparency 
and responsibility regarding sustainable financing  The SFC 
is responsible for the evaluation and selection process for 
financing under Boliden’s Green Financing Framework to be 
adopted  The SFC is led by the Director of Treasury and consists 
of representatives from the business areas and relevant Group 
functions  The committee reports to Group management and 
ultimately to the Boliden Board 
The implementation of Boliden’s values and leader and 
co-worker principles, developed by a large number of em-
ployees from all business units in 2020–2021, continued during 
2023  The purpose is to further strengthen the company’s 
values-based culture  
Business ethics is another important area that is always high on 
the company’s agenda  The ethics and compliance function is 
responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations 
concerning anti-corruption, competition, trade sanctions, 
money laundering, data privacy, human rights, whistleblowing, 
business partner due diligence and Boliden’s Code of Conduct

| Internal control
The new, more ambitious climate targets adopted in 2022 were 
validated and approved by the SBTi at the end of 2023 
The sustainability report has been included in the annual re-
port since 2017  The Group also compiles a Sustainability Index 
containing detailed sustainability information and reports this 
according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the UN Global Compact, 
TCFD and ICMM standards  
The Sustainability Index is subject to external audit, aiming to 
emphasize the importance of sustainability work and further 
strengthen the trust among all our stakeholders regarding 
this work 
The new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) 
will apply to Boliden as of the fiscal year 2024, and the outcome 
will be reported in the Annual and Sustainability Report for 
2024, to be released during the spring of 2025  Boliden is run-
ning a project to achieve compliance  The double materiality 
assessment was performed during 2023 to define the scope of 
the reporting 
Auditors
The external auditor conducts independent audits of accounts 
to ensure that they provide an accurate, fair and compre-
hensive picture of the company’s position and economic 
performance in all material respects  The auditor also reviews 
the Board’s and the President and CEO’s administration and 
reports the findings to the Board  The auditor is in contact 
with Group management in conjunction with the audits or 
emerging issues  The auditor regularly attends Audit Commit-
tee meetings and meets with the Board once during the year 
without the management team’s presence 
The auditor also reports to the shareholders at the AGM  The 
auditing firm Deloitte AB was elected at the 2023 AGM to serve 
as the company’s auditors until the conclusion of the 2024 
AGM  Authorized public accountant Thomas Strömberg is auditor-in-charge  He is a partner at Deloitte Sweden and 
has auditing assign­
ments for Ericsson, among others  Remu-
neration to the auditors is payable against approved invoices  
See note 6 for information concerning remuneration 
Board of Directors’ report on internal control
The purpose of internal control over financial reporting is to 
provide reasonable assurance with regard to the reliability of 
the external financial reporting and to ensure that the reports 
are produced in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing principles, applicable legislation and statutes, and with 
other requirements imposed on listed companies  The Board 
has overall responsibility for ensuring that an effective internal 
control system exists within the Group  The President and CEO 
is responsible for ensuring that a process and organization 
are in place to safeguard internal control and the quality of the 
internal and external financial reporting 
Internal control function
The Group has an internal control function responsible for 
implementing processes and frameworks that safeguard in-
ternal control and ensure the quality of the financial reporting  
The internal control function reports to the Executive Vice 
President and CFO and presents reports on issues relating to 
internal control at the Audit Committee’s meetings 
Control environment
The control environment is characterized by relatively few but 
large operating units that have long operated according to 
well-established processes and control activities  To ensure a 
uniform approach and working methods, there are binding 
policies and indicative guidelines for delegated responsibility 
within the organization  An internal control framework exists 
which includes Boliden’s Code of Conduct, decision-making 
and authorization instructions, and a financial manual covering 
financial policy, accounting and reporting instructions  In addi-
tion, there are local management systems with more detailed 
instructions and descriptions of important processes  The 
Group has a uniform, standardized internal control framework 
known as BICS, which includes both financial processes and 
general IT processes 
Risk analysis
The operating units conduct ongoing risk analyses with 
regard to financial reporting  The risks inherent in the various 
accounting and reporting processes are identified, analyzed 
and documented in BICS 
Control activities
Various types of control activities are carried out in all parts of 
the accounting and reporting process on an ongoing basis  
The control activities are carried out in order to manage known 
risks and to detect and rectify any errors and discrepancies in 
the financial reporting  Documentation of significant control 
activities in the accounting and reporting process continued 
in BICS in 2023  For every risk identified, the controls used to 
manage the risk are documented 
Information and communication
Information on policies, guidelines and manuals is available on 
Boliden’s intranet and the management system  Backup infor-
mation on updates and changes to reporting and accounting 
principles is issued via email and at the regular finance and 
controller meetings  External communication is conducted in 
accordance with the Group communications policy  All infor-
mation must be communicated openly, judiciously and clearly 
Follow-up
Follow-ups, improvements and the development of systems, 
processes and controls take place on an ongoing basis  Annual 
tests are conducted on documented controls within the frame-
work of BICS  Areas where room for improvement is identified 
in conjunction with the audits are documented, analyzed and 
actioned

The Annual General Meeting (AGM) was held on April 25 in 
Garpenberg  Shareholders had the opportunity to partici-
pate either in person, by proxy or through advance voting 
(postal votes)  1,635 shareholders, representing more than 
129 million shares, participated in the AGM  The shares rep-
resented constituted approximately 47 percent of the total 
number of shares  Close to all Board members and members 
of Group management and the auditor were present at the AGM 
The AGM resolved to re-elect the Board members Helene 
Biström, Tomas Eliasson, Per Lindberg, Perttu Louhiluoto, 
Elisabeth Nilsson and Pia Rudengren  Karl-Henrik Sundström 
was re-elected as Chairman of the Board  The AGM also 
resolved to pay a dividend of SEK 15 00 per share, in total 
SEK 4,103 m (2,872), in accordance with the proposal by the 
Board, and to distribute SEK 11 50 per share by means of an 
automatic share redemption procedure  The total amount 
distributed as dividends and in the form of share redemption 
was thus SEK 7,248 m  
In accordance with the proposal of the Nomination Committee, it was resolved that Board fees of SEK 1,965,000 
shall be paid to the Chairman of the Board and SEK 655,000 
to other Board members who are not employees of the 
Company  The AGM resolved to pay fees in the amount of 
SEK 275,000 to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and an 
unchanged fee of SEK 150,000 to each of the Audit Commit-
tee’s other two members  The fee payable to each member 
of the Remuneration Committee was resolved to remain at 
SEK 75,000 
In accordance with the Nomination Committee’s proposal, 
Deloitte AB was elected as auditor up until the end of the 
next AGM, and it was resolved that the auditors’ fees be 
payable against approved invoice 
The Annual General Meeting also resolved on a long term 
share-based incentive program for certain senior manage-
ment team members and authorized the Board of Directors 
to resolve to buy back up to 40,000 shares to be delivered to 
the participants in the program 

It was also resolved to appoint Lennart Francke (Swedbank 
Robur Fonder), Karin Eliasson (Handelsbanken Fonder) and

Significant accounting and valuation principles
GENERAL ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Boliden AB (publ ), Swedish Corporate ID No  556051-4142, is a ­
limited 
liability company registered in Sweden  The Company’s registered office is 
in Stockholm at the address: Klarabergsviadukten 90, SE-101 20 Stockholm, 
Sweden  The Boliden share is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm’s Large Cap list  
The Company is the Parent Company of the Boliden Group, whose 
principal operations involve the mining and production of metals and 
operations compatible therewith 
The Consolidated Statements have been compiled in accordance with 
the EU approved International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC)  In addi-
tion, the Group applies the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recom-
mendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting regulations for corporate 
conglomerates specifying the supplements to IFRS required pursuant to 
the stipulations of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act 
The Parent Company’s functional currency is the Swedish krona (SEK) 
and this is also the reporting currency for both the Group and the Parent 
Company  
Items have been valued at their historical cost in the consolidated 
accounts, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities 
(derivative instruments), which have been valued at their fair value, and 
inventories in those cases where they are hedged at fair value 
The Parent Company’s accounting principles follow those of the Group 
with the exception of the mandatory regulations stipulated in the 
Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recommendation, RFR 2 Accounting 
for legal entities  The Parent Company’s accounting principles are pre-
sented under the heading “The Parent Company’s accounting principles” 
The most important accounting principles are presented in the note to 
which they are attributable  These principles have been applied consis-
tently for all years presented, unless otherwise specified 
The Annual and Sustainability Report was approved for publication by 
the Board on March 4, 2024  The Balance Sheets and Income Statements 
are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting on April 23, 2024 
New or amended standards from International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB), as well as interpretations and agenda 
decisions from IFRS IC that came into force in the 2023 calendar year 
During the year, a review was conducted of the material information on 
accounting principles disclosed in the Annual and Sustainability Report 
Boliden applies the excemption in IAS 12 regarding recognition and 
disclosure of deferred tax assets and liablilities under Pillar 2  For more 
information, see note 18, taxes 
In addition to above, new and amended standards, interpretations and 
agenda decision that have come into force during the financial year 
2023, have not had any effect on the Group’s financial statements  
New standards from IASB, as well as interpretations and agenda 
decisions from IFRS IC that come into force in the 2024 calendar year 
or thereafter
New and amended standards, interpretations and agenda decisions that 
come into force for the financial year beginning on January 1, 2024 are not 
expected to have any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements 
Consolidated statements
The Consolidated Statements cover the Parent Company and all compa-
nies over which the Parent Company through ownership, directly or indi-
rectly, exercises a controlling influence  The term “controlling influence” 
refers to companies in which Boliden exerts influence, is exposed to, or is 
entitled to a variable return from its involvement and in which it can use 
its influence over the company to influence its return  This is generally 
achieved by ensuring that its ownership share, and the share of votes, 
exceeds 50 percent  The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that can currently be utilized or converted are taken into account when 
assessing whether the Group is capable of exercising a controlling influ-
ence over another company  Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated 
Statements as of the point in time at which a controlling influence has 
been attained, while companies that have been sold are included in the 
Consolidated Statements up to the time when the sale occurred, meaning 
up to the point in time when controlling influence ceased to apply 
The Consolidated Statements have been compiled in accordance with 
the acquisition accounting method, which means that the historical cost 
of a company comprises the fair value of the payment made (including 
the fair value of any assets, liabilities and equity instruments issued)  
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are 
reported at their fair value at the time of acquisition  In conjunction with 
every acquisition, a determination is made as to whether a non-con-
trolling interest should be reported at fair value or at the holding’s 
proportional share of the acquired company’s net assets  When required, 
the subsidiaries’ accounts are adjusted to ensure that they follow the 
same principles applied by other Group companies  All internal transac-
tions between Group companies and intra-Group balances are elimi-
nated when the Consolidated Statements are compiled 
Conversion of foreign subsidiaries and other overseas operations
The currency in the primary economic conditions in which the subsidiary 
companies operate is the functional currency  When consolidating to the 
reporting currency, the Balance Sheets for overseas subsidiary com-
panies are converted at the exchange rates applicable at the reporting 
period end, while the Income Statements are converted at the average 
exchange rates for the reporting period  Any exchange rate differences 
arising and accumulated translation differences in respect of the conver-
sion of subsidiaries are reported as Other comprehensive income 
Boliden hedges its net investments in foreign subsidiaries to some extent 
by taking an opposite position (in the form of loans) in the relevant 
foreign currency  Exchange rate differences on hedging measures are 
reported as Other comprehensive income 
In conjunction with the sale of overseas operations whose functional 
currency is different from the Group’s reporting currency, the accumu-
lated translation differences attributable to the operations are realized in 
the Consolidated Income Statement, after deductions for any currency 
hedging activities 
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies
Receivables, liabilities and derivatives in foreign currencies are converted 
to SEK at the exchange rate applying on the closing day  Exchange rate 
differences on operating receivables and operating liabilities are included 
in the operating profit, while exchange rate differences on financial assets 
and liabilities are reported under financial items  Exchange rate effects on 
financial instruments used in cash flow hedging and the hedging of net 
investments in overseas operations, are reported under Other compre-
hensive income with the exception of any exchange rate differences on 
currency swaps in foreign currencies reported under net financial items

The Parent Company’s accounting principles
The Parent Company’s annual accounts are compiled in accordance with 
the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s 
recommendation, RFR 2 Accounting for legal entities, and the statements 
issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board  Under RFR 2, the Parent 
Company must, in the accounts for the legal entity, apply all EU-approved 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and statements to the 
extent that this is possible within the framework of the Swedish Annual 
Accounts Act and with due regard to the connection between reporting 
and taxation  The recommendation specifies the exceptions and additions 
to be made in relation to IFRS  The differences between the Group’s and 
the Parent Company’s accounting principles are described below 
Reporting of Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions
Group contributions received or made are reported as appropriations  
Shareholders’ contributions are booked directly against non-restricted 
equity by the recipient and as an increase in the item Participations in 
Group companies by the contributor 
Anticipated dividends
Anticipated dividends can be reported in those cases where the ­
Parent 
Company has the sole right to determine the size of the ­
dividend and 
has ensured that the dividend does not exceed the ­
subsidiary company’s 
dividend payment capacity 
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are not valued in the Parent Company in accor-
dance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments  Valuation is conducted on the 
basis of historical cost 
Subsidiaries
Participations in subsidiaries are reported in the Parent Company in 
accordance with the historical cost method  Transaction expenses in 
the acquisition of subsidiaries are reported as costs in the consolidated 
accounts, while in the Parent Company, they are reported as part of the 
historical cost  
Determination of the value of subsidiaries is effected when there are 
indications of a decline in value 
Note 02
Estimates and assessments
In order to compile the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
accounting principles, assessments and assumptions must be made that 
impact the reported asset and liability amounts and the income and 
expense amounts, as well as other information provided in the financial 
statements  The estimates and assessments of the Board of Directors and 
the Company’s management are based on historical experience and future 
trend forecasts  The actual outcome may differ from these assessments 
Reclamation costs
Provisions for reclamations are made on the basis of an assessment 
of future costs based on current conditions  Provisions are reviewed 
regularly by internal and external specialists and updates are made when 
necessary when the estimated useful lives, costs, technical precondi-
tions, regulations or other conditions of mine and smelter assets change  
Provisions for reclamation work totaled SEK 10,890 m (7,040); see also 
Note 25, Other provisions  Capitalized reclamation costs totaled SEK 
7,695 m (4,180); see also Note 14, Property, plant and equipment  Net 
reclamation liability totaled SEK 3,195 m (2,860) 
Boliden also has a responsibility for the reclamation of a number of 
decommissioned mines and continually reviews the requirement to make 
provisions in respect of these objects  Inspection of and risk assessments 
in relation to reclamation measures are conducted on a systematic basis 
In the event of supplementary reclamation work on a decommissioned 
mine being deemed necessary in order to comply with the require-
ments of external regulations, a provision is reported for the anticipated 
future costs  The provision is reviewed as investigations and action plans 
provide underlying data for revised costings 
To determine the size of the reclamation liability, a real discount interest 
rate of 2 5 percent (2 5) has been used 
A change in the discount rate of 0 5 percentage points would result in an 
adjustment to the reclamation liability of approximately SEK 400 m and 
a corresponding change in capitalized reclamation costs  The depreci-
ations in the years ahead should be adjusted by around +/- SEK 20 m 
with the net financial items affected by the equivalent amount but in the 
opposite direction  Valuation of inventories 
In the smelters’ process inventories and stocks of finished metals, it is diffi-
cult to differentiate between externally purchased material and mined con-
centrate from the Group’s own operations  Consequently, calculating the 
internal profit of inventories and the reported value of process inventory 
entails estimation of the proportion of process inventory and finished metal 
inventory derives from internal mining operations, based on the quantities 
of mined concentrate produced internally and purchased externally  
Pension commitments
Pension provisions are dependent on the assumptions made in conjunc-
tion with the calculations of the amounts  The assumptions refer to dis-
count interest rates, rate of salary increases, future increases in pensions, 
the number of remaining working years for employees, life expectancy, 
inflation and other factors, and are reviewed annually  The assumptions 
are made for every country in which Boliden has defined benefit pension 
plans  The most significant assumptions, in Boliden’s opinion, are with 
regard to the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and life expec-
tancy, and Boliden has choosen to present sensitivity analysis for these 
factors  Boliden’s assumptions and sensitivity analysis are presented in 
Note 24, Provisions for pensions and similar obligations  
Legal disputes
Boliden regularly analyses and evaluates outstanding legal disputes 
using internal company legal counsels and, when necessary, with the 
help of external advisors, in order to assess the need for provisions to be 
made  See Note 31, Pledged assets and contingent liabilities 
Valuation of non-current assets
Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
are based on the Company’s internal business plan and on assumptions 
with regard to future trends in for instance metal prices, treatment and 
refining charges, and exchange rates  Changes in market prices of metals, 
treatment and refining charges and currencies have a substantial effect 
on the Group’s future cash flows and hence on the estimated impairment 
requirement  Assumptions with regard to price trends for metals, treat-
ment and refining charges and currencies are based on current consen-
sus prices in the market at the time of the impairment test  For further 
information, see Note 14, Property, plant and equipment 
The depreciation periods for deferred mining costs, installations and 
equipment in mines depend on future ore extraction and the lifespan of 
the mine  The assessment of these aspects is, in turn, heavily dependent 
on mineral reserves and, consequently, on factors such as anticipated 
future metal prices  The valuation is based on assumptions that the nec-
essary environmental permits will be obtained  Changes to conditions 
may entail changes to the rate of depreciation applied in future  Business 
Area Mines develops annual life of mine production plans for the mines 
Mineral Reserves
Boliden’s Mineral Reserves are divided into two categories: probable 
and proven  The assessment is based on geological measurements 
and assumptions that are explained in greater detail on pages 48–52  
Boliden’s assessment of the size of the Mineral Reserves affects annual 
depreciation costs and impairment tests for intangible assets and prop-
erty, plant and equipment

Information per segment and geographical market
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Boliden is organized into two segments: Business Area 
Mines and Business Area Smelters  The Business Areas 
correspond to Boliden’s operating segments in that 1) the 
Business Area Managers are directly responsible to the CEO, 
2) the CEO controls the Group’s operating units via two 
Business Area Boards, one for each Business Area, through 
which the financial results are evaluated in relation to finan-
cial targets, 3) financial targets as well as investment plans 
and overhead budgets for the respective Business Areas are 
set in the business plan and budget process, 4) decisions on 
targets and resource allocation for units within the respec-
tive Business Areas are made within the respective Business 
Areas’ management groups, and 5) General Managers of 
operating units report not to the CEO but to the Business 
Area Presidents 
Business Area Mines comprises the operations of the 
Swedish mines Aitik, the Boliden Area and Garpenberg, 
the Tara mine in Ireland, and the Kevitsa mine in Finland  
Business Area Mines is also responsible for sales of mined 
concentrates 
Business Area Smelters includes the Kokkola and Odda zinc 
smelters in Finland and Norway, respectively, the Rönnskär 
and Harjavalta copper smelters in Sweden and Finland, 
respectively, and the Bergsöe lead smelter in Sweden  The 
Business Area is responsible for all sales of the smelters’ 
products and handles all raw material flows between the 
Group’s mines, smelters and customers  This includes 
responsibility for purchases of metal concentrates and recy-
cling materials from external suppliers  The copper smelters 
also recycle metal and electronic scrap and smelt nickel  The 
Bergsöe lead smelter recycles lead metal, mainly from scrap 
car batteries 
Transactions between the Business Areas, primarily involv-
ing metal concentrates, are settled on an arms’ length basis 
Set out below are details of revenues per segment and 
geographical market, showing the location of external 
customers, and providing information on major customers

Revenues
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The sale of finished metals, metal concentrates, intermedi-
ate products and by-products is recognized at the time of 
delivery to the ­
customer in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of sale, i e  revenue is recognized when control 
passes to the purchaser  
The Group’s metal concentrates are invoiced provisionally 
upon delivery  Definitive invoicing takes place when all rele-
vant parameters have been determined (concentrate, quan-
tity, metal content, ­
impurity content and metal price for the 
agreed price setting period, which is usually the average 
price on the LME in the month following delivery)  Revenues 
from the provisional invoicing are reported at the metal 
prices and exchange rates applicable on the closing day and 
adjusted continuously until definitive invoicing occurs 
The Group’s metals are invoiced to the customers at the 
time of delivery  The Group eliminates the price risk in con-
junction with the sale and purchase of metals by hedging 
the imbalance between ­
quantities purchased and sold on a 
daily basis  The smelters’ income comprises treatment and 
refining charges, free metals, compen­
sation for impurities in 
raw materials and the value of by-products 
Income from activities outside the sphere of the regular 
­
operations is reported as other operating income 
Boliden’s revenues derive primarily from the sale of metals  The following table shows external revenues broken down by 
product category  ­
The increase in sales of intermediate products is due to Rönnskär´s modified business model after the fire 
with sales of anodes instead of cathodes  Information on internal sales revenues between the segments and sales revenues 
between the geographical areas is shown in Note 3, ­

Profit-sharing system
A profit-sharing system was introduced for all Boliden Group 
­
employees in 2007  A profit share is payable when the return on 
­
capital employed exceeds 8 percent, and the maximum profit 
share (SEK 40,000/full-time employee) is payable when the return 
on capital employed reaches 18 percent  However, the annual 
maximum allocation may never exceed one-third of the dividend 
paid to shareholders  The funds may be disbursed to the employ-
ees after three years at the earliest unless otherwise regulated by 
the relevant national profit-sharing scheme  An allocation of SEK 
16,280 (30,000) per full-time employee is proposed for 2023 as the 
return on capital employed was 12 1 percent (26 6)  However, this 
is conditional upon the dividend resolution by the Annual General 
Meeting  In 2023 the maximum profit share has been increased 
from the previous 30,000 to 40,000 SEK 
REMUNERATION PAID TO BOARD MEMBERS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES
Principles
Fees as approved by the Annual General Meeting are payable to 
the Chairman of the Board and to Board Members  The President 
and employee representatives do not receive director fees 
Remuneration paid to the President and other senior executives 
comprises basic salary, variable remuneration, other benefits and 
pension  The term senior executives refers to those persons who 
have made up the Group management during the year  At year-
end, Group management comprised five members, including the 
President  All members of Group management are employed in 
Sweden 
The split between basic salary and variable remuneration shall 
be in proportion to the executive’s responsibilities and authority  
The ­
variable remuneration is maximized to 60 percent of the basic 
salary for the President, while for other senior executives, it is max-
imized to 40–50 percent of the basic salary  Of this, ten percent-
age points are ­
contingent upon the purchase of Boliden shares for 
the gross sum before tax 
Pension benefits and other benefits payable to the President and 
other senior executives are taken into account when determining 
fixed and variable remuneration

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT SETTLED BY EQUITY 
INSTRUMENTS
Accounting principles
Boliden has a share-based incentive program in the form 
of a long-term share savings program  The cost of the 
program is recognized based on the fair value per share 
right at the time of grant, calculated by an independent 
third party, and the number of shares expected to be 
earned  This remuneration is recognized as personnel costs 
during the vesting period, with an equivalent increase in 
equity  To the extent the vesting terms in the program are 
connected to market-related performance conditions (total 
shareholder return, TSR), these are taken into consider-
ation when calculating the fair value of the share rights  
Performance conditions as well as employment conditions 
(continued employment) impact personnel costs during the 
vesting period through changes in the number of shares 
expected at the end of the program  At the end of each 
reporting period, the Group reviews its assessment of the 
number of shares that are expected to be earned based on 
the performance conditions and employment conditions  
When shares are allocated, social security contributions are 
to be recognized in certain countries for the value of the 
employee benefit  The Group continuously recognizes a 
liability for social security contributions for these remuner-
ations  The liability is revalued continuously based on the 
fair value of the share-based remuneration on the Balance 
Sheet date 
Long-term share savings program
On April 25, 2023, the Annual General Meeting passed 
a resolution to implement a long-term share savings 
program, LTIP 2023/2026 aimed at the CEO, members of 
the Group Management, general managers and certain 
other key employees in the Boliden Group  The overall 
purpose of the share savings program is to maintain a close 
community of interest between employees and sharehold-
ers by incentivizing employees to increase the value of the 
company  The program is intended to attract and retain key 
employees 
The program is share-based and builds on the participants 
buying shares – investment shares – in the market  Subject 
to certain conditions, the participants are allotted up to 
three performance shares free of charge for each invest-
ment share purchased  The number of investment shares 
allocated is linked to a certain percentage of the partici-
pant’s annual fixed base salary in 2023  Performance shares 
are awarded after a period of three years  The total number 
of performance shares comprises a maximum of 40,000  
The program encompasses a maximum of 17 participants  
The allotment of performance shares is conditional to 
continued employment and an uninterrupted holding of 
allocated investment shares  In addition, two performance 
conditions are set, one financial and one sustainability 
condition 
The financial condition is linked to the total return for 
Boliden’s share (TSR)  The TSR development in 2023 com-
pared with 2026 should exceed that of a peer group of other 
companies  The measurement period is 20 trading days 
after Boliden’s publication of the year-end report each year  
For maximum allotment of performance shares, Boliden’s 
TSR must exceed that of the peer group by at least 12 5 
percentage points  
The sustainability condition relates to the reduction of 
Boliden’s carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms  A con-
dition for allotment of performance shares is that Boliden’s 
carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the 
financial year 2025 have been reduced by at least 12 percent 
compared to Boliden’s carbon dioxide emissions in absolute 
terms in the financial year 2021 
The financial condition is weighted with 80% and the sus-
tainability condition with 20 percent when determining the 
allotment of performance shares 
The grant date for the long-term share savings program was 
July 1, 2023 
In accordance with the terms and conditions, Boliden’s 
Group Management and certain other key employees in the 
Group, a total of 15 people, have acquired or already hold 
11,672 shares  LTIP 2023/2026 may comprise a maximum of 
35,016 performance shares in Boliden  To ensure delivery of 
shares under LTIP 2023/2026, Boliden AB has on 20 October 
2023 repurchased 40,000 shares, for a total amount of SEK 
11 m  As the total number of shares in Boliden amounts to 
273,511,169, this corresponds to 0 002 percent of the total 
number of shares  The cost for the program, excluding 
social security contributions, is reported based on the fair 
value per share right at the time of allotment, amounting 
to SEK 180 4, and the estimated number of shares that will 
be vested  Total cost for the year 2023 amounted to SEK 1 4 
m, of which social security contributions amounted to SEK 
0 3 m  There are no other ongoing long-term share savings 
programs

Government subsidies
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Government support refers to subsidies, grants or premiums 
designed to provide an economic benefit, or Government support 
in the form of transfers of resources to the company in exchange 
for the latter’s meeting or agreeing to meet certain future con-
ditions  Government support attributable to assets is reported 
either by recognizing the support as a prepaid income or by 
reducing the reported value of the asset  Other contributions are 
recognized as other income, or as a reduction in costs during the 
same reporting period the contributions are intended to cover  
The costs involved are personnel costs and energy costs 
Government subsidies totaling SEK 530 m (246) were received in 
2023, SEK 226 m (182) was reported in the Income Statement, and 
the asset’s value was reduced by SEK 252 m (60)  The majority of 
the subsidies were received in Norway under a carbon dioxide 
compensation scheme and for energy efficiency improvement 
measures, and in Finland in respect of electrification support, and 
are reported under cost of goods sold in the Income Statement

Intangible assets
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Exploration, research and development
Boliden’s R&D primarily comprises exploration  Boliden is also 
involved, to a limited extent, in developing mining and smelting 
processes  Expenses associated with research and development 
are primarily booked as costs when they arise, and are reported 
under the item “Research and development costs” in the Income 
Statement  When the financial potential for the exploitation of a 
mine deposit has been confirmed, the expenses are booked as 
costs up to that date  After that date, the expenses are capitalized 
as deferred mining costs, whose principles are described in Note 
14, Property, plant and equipment  Exploration rights acquired in 
conjunction with business acquisitions have been capitalized as 
intangible assets  
Acquired exploration rights are assessed to have an indefinite 
useful life as there is no predictable limit on the time during 
which the asset is expected to generate net payments to Boliden  
Impairment testing in respect of exploration rights is carried out in 
accordance with IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral 
Resources, and impairment testing is, therefore, only carried out in 
the presence of an indication that the need to write down an asset 
exists  
Patents, licenses and similar rights
Intangible assets also include patents, licenses and similar rights  
They are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
Goodwill
Goodwill arises at the time of acquisition when the historical cost 
exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets of the subsidiary company  Goodwill is reported in the 
Balance Sheet at the value given in conjunction with the acqui-
sition, ­
converted, where relevant, at the closing day rate, after 
deduction for accumulated impairments  Calculations of the profit 
or loss on the sale of a unit include any remaining reported good-
will value ascribed to the operations sold 
Goodwill has been assessed as having an indefinite useful life  
Goodwill is allocated to the smallest possible unit or group of units 
that generate cash where separate cash flows can be identified, 
and an impairment test is performed on the reported value at 
least once a year to determine whether there is any need for an 
impairment  Such impairment tests are, however, performed more 
frequently if there are indications that the value may have fallen 
during the year 
Emission allowances
The Boliden Group participates in the European system for emis-
sion rights  Rights are allocated across the European market  One 
­
emission right grants entitlement to emit the equivalent of one 
tonne of carbon dioxide or similar gas and is classified as an intan-
gible asset  Allocated emission rights are valued at the historical 
cost of zero, while rights acquired are valued at the purchase price  
An intangible asset and a provision in the corresponding amount 
are reported during the current year in the event of any need 
arising to purchase additional emission rights  The asset is amor-
tized over the remaining months of the year, thereby distributing 
the cost in line with production  The intangible asset is thereby 
exhausted and the provision for emissions made is adjusted  If the 
liability to deliver emission rights exceeds the remaining emission 
rights allocation, the liability is revalued at the market value of the 
number of emission rights required to clear the undertaking on 
the closing day 
Impairments
On each reporting occasion, an assessment is performed to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment in respect 
of the Group’s assets  Should this be the case, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is calculated  Goodwill, together with any 
intangible assets with indefinable useful lives, is subject to annual 
impairment tests even if there are no indications of a reduction 
in its value  The recoverable amount comprises whichever is the 
higher of the value in use of the asset in the operations and the 
value that would result if the asset were sold to an independent 
party, fair value minus selling expenses  The value in use com-
prises the present value of all incoming and outgoing payments 
attributable to the asset for the duration of its expected use in 
the operations, plus the present value of the net sales value at the 
end of the asset’s useful life  The period during which use of the 
asset is expected to be possible is based on the assumption that 
the necessary environmental permits can be obtained  If the esti-
mated recoverable amount is lower than the book value, the latter 
is written down to the former 
Impairments are reported in the Income Statement  Any impair-
ment is reversed if changes in the assumptions leading to the orig-
inal impairment mean that the impairment is no longer warranted  
Impairments that have been performed are not reversed in such a 
way that the reported value exceeds the amount that would, fol-
lowing deductions for depreciation and amortization according to 
plan, have been reported if no impairment had been performed  
Reversals of impairments are reported in the Income Statement  
Goodwill impairments are not reversed  See also the section in

Goodwill 
The Group’s goodwill item arose primarily in conjunction 
with the acquisition of the operations from Outokumpu at 
the end of ­
December 2003  Goodwill from the 2003 acqui-
sition has principally been allocated to the Group’s Smelters 
segment  Impairment tests have been carried out on the 
goodwill value as described in Note 14 under Impairment 
tests for the year – Intangible assets and ­
Property, plant and 
equipment  
Emission allowances 
The Boliden Group did not sell any emission rights in 2023 
Exploration rights 
During 2022, a resolution was passed to close the explora-
tion operations in the Outokumpu field and the exploration 
rights were impaired in their entirety

Property, plant and equipment
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Land, plants and equipment and associated capitalized costs for 
development and pre-production measures, are booked at histor-
ical cost less depreciation and any impairment  Interest expenses 
attributable to financing development and completion of signif-
icant items of property, plant and equipment are included in the 
acquisition value  Repair and maintenance expenses are booked 
as costs, while substantial improvements and replacements are 
capitalized  
Estimated future expenses for the dismantling and removal of a 
tangible asset and the restoration of a site or area where the tangi-
ble asset is located (reclamation costs) are capitalized  Capitalized 
amounts comprise estimated expenses, calculated at current 
value, which are simultaneously reported as provisions  Effects of 
subsequent events that result in costs that exceed the provision 
are discounted, capitalized as a tangible asset and increase the 
provisions, and are depreciated over the remaining life of the 
asset  
Deferred mining costs at mines comprise the waste rock excava-
tion required to access the ore body, work relating to infrastruc-
tural facilities, roads, tunnels, shafts and inclined drifts, as well as 
service, electricity and air distribution facilities  Deferred mining 
costs arising from expanding the capacity of the mining opera-
tion, the development of new ore bodies, and the preparation of 
mining areas for future ore production are capitalized  Mining 
costs arising from waste rock removal from open pit mines are 
capitalized as part of an asset when it becomes possible to identify 
the part of an ore body to which access has been improved  
Depreciation principles for Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation according to plan is based on the original capitalized 
­
values and the estimated useful life, and begins when an asset is 
ready to become operational  
Plants and capitalized values attributable to waste rock are 
depreciated by pushback and in conjunction with metal extraction 
in ­
relation to the anticipated metal extraction for the entire push-
back  Plants and capitalized values included in deferred mining 
costs are depreciated in accordance with a production-based 
depreciation method that is based on the Proven and Probable 
Mineral Reserves in the respective ore bodies  Depreciation is 
effected to the estimated residual value  Estimated residual values 
and production capacity are subject to ongoing review  Plant not 
directly linked to production capacity is depreciated on the basis 
of its anticipated lifespan  The estimated useful life is based on 
the assumption that the necessary environmental permits can be 
obtained 
Smelters and production plants are depreciated linearly over their 
anticipated useful lives  
The following depreciation periods are applied to Property, plant 
and equipment, including future reclamation costs: Buildings	
20–50 years
Land improvements	
20 years
Deferred mining costs and	
Concurrently with 
waste rock capitalization metal extraction
Capitalized reclamation costs	

Linearly over the 
­
anticipated lifetime
Processing facilities	
10–25 years
Machinery 3–10 years
Inventories	
3–10 years
Boliden applies component depreciation, which means that larger 
processing facilities are broken down into component parts with 
­
different useful lives and thus different depreciation periods

Annual impairment test – Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment
Impairment tests are carried out yearly, or throughout the year if 
an event occurs that may result in an impairment requirement, and 
are based on the Group’s annual budget and strategic planning 
work  The planning horizon is the estimated lifespan of each mine, 
based on the existing mineral reserve, usually between 5 to 30 
years  Smelters establishes plans for 10 years  Boliden’s operations 
are characterized by long-term production plans in which every 
mine has set production plans for the entire estimated life­
span 
of the mine in question, while a substantial part of the smelters’ 
concentrate supply is regulated by means of long-term delivery 
agreements  The plans also include assessments of environmental 
issues based on external analyses, risks and opportunities  The 
most important environmental issues are included in the strategic 
work, where targets, metrics and activity plans are clarified  
Investments shall be assessed on the basis of environmental 
impact and be in support of Boliden’s business strategy of being 
a prioritized metal supplier for a sustainable society  Production 
plans are based on the assumption that the permits needed to 
conduct the operations can be obtained and, where necessary, 
renewed  This long-term production planning also allows the use 
of long-term cash flow forecasts  Additional growth assumptions 
are not included in extrapolated cash flow forecasts beyond the 
planning horizon, which means that smelters’ cash flows from year 
eleven onwards are extrapolated using year ten as a base, after 
which no growth is taken into account  
The value of discounted cash flows is highly sensitive to metal 
prices, treatment and refining charges (TC/RC), and exchange 
rates (see sensitivity table in Note 28)  The present value of esti-
mated future cash flows is based on current consensus prices, i e  
a joint market assessment  Current consensus prices are available 
through compilations from a number of analysis firms  
The current consensus prices used in the impairment test are 
shown in the table below 
Individual mines or mining areas with centralized concentrating 
facilities, copper smelters, zinc smelters, Boliden Bergsöe AB 
and Boliden Commercial AB are classified as cash-generating 
units  The discounted real cash flows before tax for the relevant 
cash-generating units are compared with the book value of capital 
employed  The cash flows are discounted with a real discount rate 
before tax of 9 percent (9), which corresponds to the weighted 
average capital cost  The Group’s goodwill is allocated to segment 
Smelters, rather than to cash-generating units, in accordance with 
monitoring of goodwill  The value in use of the Group’s assets is 
estimated to exceed the carrying amount of all cash-generating 
units  The Tara zinc mine book value, EUR 215 m, is marginally 
below the estimated value in use  The Tara zinc mine is currently 
put in care and maintenance since July 2023  The estimated value 
in use is based on the mine being restarted in 2024  The value of 
Tara is continuously monitored in terms of metal prices, exchange 
rates and treatment charges for zinc  In the case of the completed 
sensitivity analysis presented below, Tara demonstrates sensitivity 
to changed assumptions 
 An increase in the discount rate by one percentage point would 
have led to a need for impairment of one cash-generating unit 
in the Mines segment, the Tara mine  A 10 percent reduction of 
all current consensus prices for metals would not lead to any 
need for impairment in the Smelters segment, but for the Mines 
segment, such a reduction would mean that the book value would 
exceed the discounted cash flows in respect of the Tara mine and 
Boliden Area  If current consensus prices for metals were to remain 
unchanged, a 10 percent weakening of the US dollar against all 
other currencies would not require an impairment requirement for 
segment Mines or Smelters  The calculation does not include any 
compensatory movements in metal prices, TC/RC, or the prices 
of by-products or input goods, which has historically often been 
the case  A 10 percent fall in TC/RC for all metals would not result 
in any impairment requirement in the Smelters segment; in the 
Mines segment, the same reduction would have a positive effect

Note 15
Leases
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The lease agreements are recognized as right-of-use assets 
and equivalent liabilities, and reported on the day the 
leased asset is ­
available for use by the Group  The calcula-
tion of the liability for a leased asset is based on the current 
value of the remaining lease charges, discounted by the 
implicit borrowing rate  If this cannot be determined, the 
discounting takes place instead using the marginal borrow-
ing rate  The liability is recognized under Other interest-­
bearing liabilities, split between a current and a non-current 
part  Each lease payment is distributed between amortiza-
tion of the debt and financial expense  The financial cost is 
distributed over the lease period so that each accounting 
period is burdened with an amount corresponding to a fixed 
interest rate for the liability reported during the relevant 
period  The right-of-use assets is initially valued at historical 
cost, which is made up of the sum of the lease liability, any 
direct expenses and reclamation costs  The right-of-use 
asset is ­
recognized as Property, plant and equipment in the 
Balance Sheet, broken down between the items Buildings 
and land as well as ­
Machinery and other technical facilities  
Depreciation takes place ­
linearly over time  The Boliden 
Group’s lease agreements comprise various properties, 
land, mining and service machinery, concentrate stores and 
excavators  The lease contracts vary in length, although the 
majority are between 3 
–10 years with a few exceptions that 
are longer  The terms are negotiated ­
separately for each 
agreement and vary  The leased assets may not be used 
as collateral for loans  Some agreements contain variable 
lease payments that are based on an index or interest rate  
Changes to the index first affect the lease liability in the 
period when cash flow from the change occurs  At this time, 
the lease liability is recalculated and adjusted against the 
right-of-use asset  The option of extending an agreement 
is included in a few of the Group’s leases for vehicles and 
equipment, and has not been included in the lease liability 
because the Group does not consider it reasonably certain 
that these options will be exercised  Revaluation of lease 
liability is carried out for example in the event of amended 
assessments of the utilization of options as well as amended 
assessments of the outcome of residual value guarantees 
A lease agreement running for less than 12 months, known 
as a short-term lease, or a lease that relates to the lease of a 
low-value asset, is exempt and is not included when deter-
mining liability and right-of-use assets, rather these are 
booked linearly in the item Cost of goods sold in the Income 
Statement  This also applies to agreements with variable 
pricing, such as certain transport agreements  Low value 
leases include IT equipment, office equipment and the hire 
of building modules  See also Note 29, Maturity structure

Tax
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The tax expense (income) for the period comprises current tax and 
deferred tax  Tax is reported in the Income Statement, Other com-
prehensive income or Equity, depending on where the underlying 
transaction has been reported 
Current tax is the tax calculated on the taxable profit/loss for 
each period  The year’s taxable profit/loss differs from the year’s 
reported profit/loss before tax in that it has been adjusted for 
non-taxable and non-deductible items and temporary differences  
The Group’s ­
current tax liability is calculated in accordance with 
the tax rates applicable on the closing day 
Deferred tax is reported using the Balance Sheet method, under 
which deferred tax liabilities are reported in the Balance Sheet for 
all taxable temporary differences between reported and fiscal 
values of assets and liabilities  Deferred tax assets are reported 
in the Balance Sheet in respect of tax losses carried-forward and 
all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is likely 
that these amounts can be used to offset future taxable surpluses  
The reported value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end 
of each accounting period and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer likely that sufficient taxable surpluses will be available for its 
use  Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the period in which the asset is recovered 
or the liability settled  
Both deferred and current tax receivables and tax liabilities are 
offset when they relate to income tax levied by the same tax 
authority  The Group is subject to OECD’s model rules for Pillar 2  Legislation 
on Pillar 2 is in effect as of January 1, 2024 in Sweden  In accor-
dance with 4a of IAS 12, the Group applies the exception for 
reporting and disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities for 
Pillar 2 income taxes 
The Group has assessed its potential exposure to Pillar 2 
income taxes  Applying the temporary relief rules, the so-called 
“Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour”, the Group has performed 
calculations based on its Country-by-Country reporting for 2023  
According to the calculations, all companies within the Group 
qualify for the Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour in 2023, and there 
are no circumstances that indicate that this will change in the 
coming year  The Group therefore expects no exposure to Pillar 2 
income taxes

Inventories
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The Group’s inventories primarily comprise mine concentrates, 
materials tied up in the smelters’ production processes and 
finished metals  Inventories are valued at whichever is the lower 
of the ­
historical cost in accordance with the first-in-first-out prin-
ciple and the net realizable value, taking into account the risk of 
obsolescence  The historical cost of inventories of metals from the 
company’s mines and semi-finished and finished products manu-
factured in house comprises the direct manufacturing costs plus 
a surcharge for indirect manufacturing costs  Supplies inventories 
are valued at whichever is the lower of the average historical cost 
and the replacement value  When mine concentrates are bought in 
from external sources and definitive pricing has not yet occurred, 
the acquisition value is estimated at the closing day price  Fair 
value hedging is effected in conjunction with the definitive pricing 
of mined concentrates  The change in the value of hedged items in 
the inventory value is also reported in conjunction with fair value 
hedging of mined concentrates and finished metals

Trade receivables
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Receivables are reported at the anticipated recoverable amount, i e after deductions for expected credit losses  The anticipated 
term of trade receivables is short, the value is therefore reported 
at the nominal amount without any discounting, in accordance 
with the amortized cost method  See Note 26 for further informa-
tion on accounting principles for financial instruments 
Boliden applies the simplified method for reporting expected 
credit losses through trade receivables  Based on assessments that 
reflect an objective and probability-weighted outcome, a general 
provision is reported based on reasonable and verifiable data 
derived from historical, current and forward-looking conditions  
For information on the management of credit risks, see Credit risks 
in trade receivables on page 56 in the Risk management section of 
the ­
Directors’ Report 
On December 31, 2023, trade receivables falling due for payment 
in more than 30 days totaled SEK 47 m (57), corresponding to 1 2 
percent (1 5) of total trade receivables  Provisions for expected 
credit losses are not material

The Articles of Association for Boliden AB state that the share

SEK 800 m  Share capital comprises a single class of share 
There are no potential shares and hence no dilution effect 
The Annual General Meeting held on April 25, 2023 resolved to 
pay a dividend of SEK 15 00 per share, in all SEK 4,103 m  At the 
same time, a resolution was passed concerning an automatic 
redemption procedure whereby each share would be split into one 
ordinary share and one redemption share  The redemption share 
was then automatically redeemed for SEK 11 50 per share to a total 
of SEK 3,145 m 
Boliden’s Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General 
Meeting that a dividend of SEK 7 50 (15 00) per share be paid, 
equivalent to a total of SEK 2,051 m  Boliden’s dividend policy 
requires approximately one-third of the net profit after tax to be 
disbursed 
Buy-back of own shares
To ensure delivery of shares under the Long-term share savings 
program, LTIP 2023/2026, Boliden AB has on October 20, 2023 
repurchased 40,000 shares, for a total amount of SEK 11 m  As 
the total number of shares in Boliden amounts to 273,511,169, this 
corresponds to 0 002 percent of the total number of shares in 
Boliden 
Earnings per share
Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit for the 
period attributable to the owners of the Parent Company by the 
average number of shares  
Asset management

is presented on page 81  There is also a description of the

Boliden monitors its capital structure e g  with the aid of the net 
debt/equity ratio  The net debt/equity ratio is calculated as the net 
of interest-bearing provisions and liabilities less financial assets 
including cash and cash equivalents, divided by equity

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Employee benefits
Pension commitments
The Group’s companies have a variety of pension systems in 
accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries in 
which they operate  These are generally financed through pay-
ments made to insurance companies or through the company’s 
own provisions, which are determined through periodic actuarial 
calculations  The Group’s provisions for pension commitments are 
calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits 
For pension systems where the employer is committed to defined 
contribution systems, the obligation in relation to the employee 
ceases when the agreed premiums have been paid  Premiums paid 
are booked as costs on an ongoing basis 
The obligation does not cease for pension systems where a 
defined benefit pension has been contractually agreed, until the 
agreed pensions have been paid out  Boliden commissions inde-
pendent actuaries to calculate pension obligations relating to the 
defined benefit pension plan arrangements in each country  For 
information on calculation parameters, see Note 2, Estimates and 
assessments: Pension commitments  
Revaluations of the defined benefit net pension liability, such 
as actuarial gains and or losses and the difference between 
the return on plan assets and the discount rate, are reported 
under Other comprehensive income including attributable 
special payroll tax  The financing cost of the net pension liabil-
ity is calculated using the discount rate for the pension liability  
The financing cost, the cost of ­
service during the current period 
and any previous periods, losses from settlements and costs in 
connection with special payroll tax are all reported in the Income 
Statement  Special payroll tax is regarded as part of the total net 
pension liability 
Boliden has established pension plans in the countries in which 
the company operates  The pension plans include both defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans  The defined benefit plans 
provide the employee with a fixed amount of their final salary in 
conjunction with retirement  Boliden’s defined benefit pension 
plans are mainly operated in Sweden and Ireland, and to a small 
extent in Norway and ­
Finland  The defined contribution plans 
comply with local regulations in the respective countries  Boliden 
has defined contribution plans in Sweden, Ireland, Finland and 
Norway 
Sweden
Boliden’s pension obligations in Sweden are not invested in funds  
The pension obligations are secured through the Swedish PRI/
FPG system and through insurance companies  The majority of the 
pension commitments for salaried employees are secured through 
insurance with Alecta and are lifelong retirement pensions  The 
benefits offered by the lifelong pensions are determined using 
different percentages for different salary intervals  Alecta has 
not provided sufficient information for the 2023 financial year 
for the ITP plan to be reported as a defined benefit plan, thus it is 
reported as a defined contribution plan under UFR 10, Reporting 
of ITP 2 pension plan financed through insurance with Alecta  A 
surplus in Alecta can be allocated to the policyholders and or 
those insured  At the end of the year, Alecta’s collective consolida-
tion level was 158 percent (172)  The collective consolidation level 
comprises the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of 
the insurance commitments calculated in accordance with Alecta’s 
actuarial calculation assumptions, which do not correspond with 
those of IAS 19  Boliden’s pension obligations account for only a 
very small percentage of Alecta’s insurance commitments  There 
are, in addition to the ITP plans, a few previously earned tempo-
rary retirement pensions within Boliden  
“Gruvplanen” (GP) is a pension agreement for underground 
workers  The plan grants underground workers entitlement to 
receive a pension between the ages of 60 and 65 and between 
65 and 70 under certain preconditions based on an average 
income  The “Gruvplanen” plan was closed to new earners in 2011 
and replaced by a defined contribution pension plan (GLP)  The 
commitments change from vesting to non-vesting in conjunction 
with retirement 
Ireland
The pension commitment is secured by the transfer of funds to 
four defined benefit plans and one defined contribution plan  The 
defined benefit plans are closed to new employees  The pension 
plans are governed by the Irish Pensions Board and Irish Pensions 
Legislation  All of the defined benefit pension plans are funded  
The largest defined benefit plan and the defined contribution 
pension plan both have Board Members from the company and 
the members  Boliden has appointed the Irish Pension Trust to 
manage the other defined benefit plans  
The financial position of the pension plans is reviewed every three 
years by an actuary in order to determine the requisite financing 
level  The actuary ensures that Boliden receives annual reports on 
the financial position in accordance with accounting requirements  
Payments are made to all five plans through a combination of con-
tributions from both Boliden and employees in accordance with 
employment contracts  No other deposits are made  
The Board of the pension plans is responsible for investments in 
plan assets  A significant proportion of plan assets are placed in 
European government bonds to reduce the risk  Cash and cash 
equivalents are held in order to facilitate pension disbursements 
Events during the year
The current value of Boliden’s pension commitment is slightly 
higher than last year’s level, largely due to the effect of amended 
­
assumptions  
The Group’s reported pension liability was SEK 1,128 m (953)  The 
amount includes endowment insurance and similar commitments 
totaling SEK 132 m (127) in respect of defined contribution pension 
plans in Sweden 
Actuarial assumptions during the year
Costs, commitments and other factors in pension plans are cal-
culated by means of the Projected Unit Credit Method, using the 
assumptions shown in the table on the next page 
The discount rate is established for every geographical market 
with reference to the market return on company bonds on the 
closing day  In Sweden, where there is no functioning market for 
such bonds, the market return on housing bonds has been used 
and a premium for a longer term added, based on the duration of 
the pension ­
obligations 
The financing cost of the net pension liability is calculated using 
the discount rate and is reported under Boliden’s net financial 
items

The sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the basis of the 
above actuarial changes, as Boliden is of the opinion that they can 
have a substantial impact on the pension liability  It is also likely 
that changes to these assumptions will be made  The calculations 
have been performed by means of the analysis of each change 
individually, and the calculations have not taken into account any 
interdependence between the assumptions  No sensitivity analy-
ses have been conducted for Norway and Finland as the amounts 
in question are insignificant  Other countries have no defined 
benefit pension liabilities

Other provisions
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Provisions are reported when the Group has, or may be consid-
ered to have, an obligation as a result of events that have occurred 
and it is likely that disbursements will be required in order to fulfill 
this obligation  A further prerequisite is that it should be possible 
to make a reliable estimate of the amount to be disbursed 
When a significant effect arises due to the point in time at which 
a provision is made, the provision is valued at the present value of 
the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation  Here, 
a discount interest rate is used before tax that reflects current 
market evaluations of the time value of money in the long term 
and the risks associated with the provision  The increase due to the 
passing of time is reported as an interest expense  Provisions are 
broken down into current and non-current parts 
With the exception of pensions (see Note 24), Boliden’s provisions 
refer primarily to reclamation costs that are expected to arise 
when an operation is decommissioned  Provisions are also made 
for any purchases of emission rights and for any remuneration 
payable in conjunction with the termination of employment 
that may be payable to employees to whom a commitment of 
termination has been given or to employees who accept volun-
tary redundancy  The Group reports a provision and a cost in 
conjunction with a termination when Boliden is obligated either 
to give the employee notice prior to the normal point in time for 
employment’s cessation, or to provide remuneration with a view 
to encouraging early retirement

Reclamation costs
Provisions for reclamation costs are made on the basis of an 
assessment of future costs based on current technology and other 
conditions  The present value of assessed reclamation liabilities are 
reserved in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabili-
ties and IFRIC 1 Changes in existing decommissioning, restoration 
and similar liabilities  We strive to achieve gradual reclamation, but 
most reclamation work takes place following a decision to decom-
mission  In historical terms, Boliden has succeeded in extending 
the useful life of its mining assets compared with the original 
plans  Provisions for reclamation are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis  Additions to existing provisions relate mainly to Aitik and 
Garpenberg  Aitik’s reclamation reserve is expanded to be based 
on the entire life of the mine, 2047  This will be included in the the 
new operating permit application  Garpenberg has made certain 
technical adjustments to the reclamation plan for the tailings facil-
ity, which affects the size of the reclamation reserve 
To determine the size of the reclamation liability, a discount 
interest rate of 2 5 percent (2 5) was used  A sensitivity analysis in 
respect of the discount rate is presented in Note 2, Estimates and 
assessments

Financial instruments
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
The following financial instruments, i e  financial assets and liabili-
ties, are recognized in the Balance Sheet: shares, receivables, cash 
and cash equivalents, liabilities and derivatives 
Financial instruments are recognized in the Balance Sheet when 
the company becomes bound by the instrument’s contractual 
terms (the economic approach)  However, liabilities to credit insti-
tutions are not reported until the settlement date  Financial assets 
are removed from the Balance Sheet when the rights entailed by 
the agreement are utilized, matured or are transferred to another 
counterparty  Financial liabilities are removed from the Balance 
Sheet when the agreement’s obligations are fulfilled or if signifi-
cant aspects of the loan terms are renegotiated  
Financial instruments are reported at the fair value or amortized 
cost, depending on the initial categorization under IFRS 9 Financial 
instruments  
Changes to IFRS 9 resulting from the exchange of reference 
rates (interbank offered rates), “Interest Rate Benchmark Reform 
amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7”, have had no effect on 
these financial reports 
VALUATION PRINCIPLES
Fair value
The fair value of derivatives is based on listed bid and ask prices 
on the closing day and on a discounting of estimated cash flows  
Market prices for metals are taken from the trading locations of 
metal derivatives, i e  the London Metal Exchange (LME) and the 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)  Discount rates are 
based on current market rates per currency and time to maturity 
for the financial instrument  Exchange rates are obtained from 
Riksbanken (Swedish Central Bank) 
When presenting the fair value of liabilities to credit institutions, 
the fair value is calculated as discounted agreed amortizations 
and interest payments at estimated market interest margins  The 
fair value of trade receivables and trade and other payables is 
deemed to be the same as the reported value due to the short 
term to maturity, to the fact that provisions are made for expected 
credit losses, and to the fact that any penalty interest incurred will 
be debited  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is deemed 
to be the same as the reported value, since the expected credit 
losses are insignificant  The general credit rating of the banks has 
been applied in order to calculate credit losses which have been 
deemed to be insignificant 
If changes in value cannot be determined for financial assets or 
liabilities reported at fair value, they are reported at the historical 
costs of the instruments at the time of acquisition, which corre-
sponds to the fair value at the time of acquisition  
Boliden provides information on all financial assets and liabilities 
reported at fair value in the Balance Sheet on the basis of a three-
level fair value hierarchy  Level 1 comprises instruments that are 
listed and traded on an active market where identical instruments 
are traded  Level 2 comprises instruments that are not traded on 
an active market, but where observable market data is used for 
valuation of the instrument (either directly or indirectly)  Level 3 
comprises instruments where the valuation is, to a considerable 
extent, based on unobservable market data 
The assessments have been conducted on the basis of the circum-
stances and factors that apply with regard to the various instru-
ments  Metal futures are classified as level 2, in that the discounted 
prices are based on listed daily prices from the stock exchanges  
Currency futures and interest rate swaps have also been classified 
as level 2, with reference to the fact that the valuation is based 
on observable market data  The fair value of liabilities to credit 
institutions has been classified as level 2, as these are calculated as 
discounted agreed amortizations and interest payments at esti-
mated market interest rate levels  The fair value therefore essen-
tially corresponds to the reported value  Shares and participations 
that are not listed have been classified as level 3  Exceptions to 
classification on the basis of the fair value hierarchy are made for 
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other 
payables where the reported value is deemed to constitute a 
reasonable estimation of the fair value 
Amortized cost
Amortized cost is calculated using the effective interest rate 
method  This means that any premiums or discounts, as well as 
expenses or income directly attributable to them, are distributed 
over the duration of the contract using calculated effective interest 
rate  The effective interest rate yields the instrument’s historical 
cost as a result in conjunction with current value calculation of 
future cash flows  
Financial assets at amortized cost
The financial assets in this category include financial investments, 
cash and cash equivalents, and receivables not listed on an active 
market  These financial instruments are characterized by being 
part of a business model whose purpose is to be held until matu-
rity and to collect cash flows from payments of principals and any 
interest  
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments in the category fair value through profit or 
loss are characterized by being part of a business model whose 
purpose is to be held until maturity or held for sale, and which are 
expected to be sold in a near future  Financial assets in this cate-
gory are valued at fair value and changes in value are reported in 
the Income ­
Statement

Note 27
Financial derivative instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives
Derivatives valued at fair value, and for which changes in value are 
reported in net financial items, consist of currency futures and are 
not included in the hedge accounting 
Hedge accounting
Derivatives used in hedge accounting comprise derivatives valued 
at fair value included in fair value hedging or cash flow hedging  
The derivatives comprise metal futures, currency futures and 
interest rate derivatives  The hedge relationship is identified 
and documented  For Boliden’s risk management policies and 
strategy objectives for the hedge, see also, “Risk management” 
in the Directors’ Report on pages 53–57  An assessment of hedge 
efficency is documented both when hedging commences and on 
an ongoing basis  Efficacy is assessed by means of an analysis of 
the economic correlation between the hedged item and hedging 
instrument, and by ensuring that the effect of the credit risk does 
not dominate changes in value of underlying items and instru-
ments  The hedge ratio for the hedge relationship is the same as in 
the actual hedge  
Fair value hedging (binding undertakings)
Changes in value of financial derivatives used to hedge a binding 
undertaking are reported under the operating profit together 
with changes in value of the asset or liability that the hedging 
is designed to counter  Parts of inventories constitute binding 
undertakings and are reported at market value as inventory value  
Changes in value of derivatives consequently effectively match the 
changes in value from hedged items in the Income Statement and 
Balance Sheet 
Cash flow hedging (forecast cash flows)
Hedge accounting is applied to financial derivatives that refer to 
the hedging of forecast flows  This means that the effective part of 
the unrealized market values is reported as other comprehensive 
income up to the point in time when the hedged item, such as fore-
cast metal sales, US dollar income and interest expenses, is realized 
and thus reported in the Income Statement  Realized gains/losses 
attributable to metal and currency derivatives are reported in net 
sales, while the gains/losses on interest rate derivatives are reported 
in net financial items  If the hedge refers to a non-financial item such 
as major investments concluded in foreign currency, the capitalized 
earnings from equity is transferred to the asset’s ­
historical cost and 
then booked in the Income Statement in line with depreciations  
Any ineffective part of cash flow hedging is reported as operating 
profit or net financial items  
Hedging of net investments
Hedge accounting in respect of net investments in overseas oper-
ations is reported as other comprehensive income  Any ineffective 
component of these hedges is reported under net financial items  In 
conjunction with the sale of overseas operations, associated hedging 
results are reported in the Income Statement, together with the trans-
lation effect of the net investment 
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
The offsetting of financial assets and liabilities is regulated by ISDA 
(International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements, which 
regulate both offsetting between contracted counterparties as part 
of operating activities and in conjunction with circumstances relating 
to breach of contract or early termination  See also the Risk manage-
ment section for dealing with counterparty risk, pages 53–57

Note 29
Financial liabilities and maturity structure
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
Financial liabilities primarily consist of liabilities to credit insti-
tutions and trade and other payables  The anticipated term of 
trade and other payables is short, and the value is consequently 
reported at a nominal amount in accordance with the amortized 
cost method as the amount is considered to correspond to the 
value  Liabilities to credit institutions are initially valued at amounts 
received, less any arrangement fees, and are then valued at amor-
tized cost  Interest expenses are reported on an ongoing basis in 
the Income Statement with the exception of the part included in 
the historical cost for property, plant and equipment  Capitalized 
arrangement fees are reported directly against the loan liability 
to the extent that the loan agreement’s underlying loan guaran-
tee has been utilized, and are allocated over time in the Income 
Statement as other financial expenses over the contractual term of 
the loan  If a loan agreement is terminated or otherwise ceases to 
apply at a point in time prior to the end of the original contractual 
term, capitalized arrangement fees are recognized as an expense  
If a current agreement is renegotiated during the contractual 
term, any additional fees in connection with the renegotiation are 
allocated over the remaining contractual term of the loan

Pledged assets and contingent liabilities
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
A contingent liability is a potential undertaking that derives from 
events which have occurred and whose incidence is only confirmed 
by one or more uncertain future events  A contingent liability can 
also be an existing undertaking that has not been reported in the 
Balance Sheet because it is unlikely that an outflow of resources 
will be required or because the size of the undertaking cannot be 
reliably calculated

in respect of unutilized credits total SEK 12,874 m (11,259)  
Other sureties and guarantees refer primarily to counter under-
takings issued by Boliden to banks or other lenders  These have, 
in turn, with regard to states or authorities, guaranteed Boliden’s 
proper completion of reclamation undertakings 
In addition to that specified above under the heading of contin-
gent liabilities and the items included in the financial information, 
the possibility exists that the Group may incur environment related 
contingent liabilities or contingent liabilities attributable to legal 
proceedings and claims, which cannot be calculated at present but 
which may, in future, entail costs or investments 
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Overview
Boliden may occasionally be involved in disputes and legal pro-
ceedings arising in the course of its operations  These disputes 
and legal proceedings are not expected, either individually or 
collectively, to have any significant negative impact on Boliden’s 
operating profits, profitability or financial position, over and above 
that detailed below  
DISPUTES
Disputes arising from the dam accident in Spain in the late 1990s
In April 1998, a dam accident occurred at the Los Frailes mine in 
Spain, which was then owned by Boliden’s subsidiary, Boliden 
Apirsa S L  (”Apirsa”)  Investigations concluded that the accident 
had been caused by design and construction errors in the dam, 
rather than by Apirsa’s operations  
Nevertheless, the Spanish Ministry of the Environment issued a 
fine of approximately EUR 45 m towards Apirsa  In addition, the 
local government (Junta de Andalucia) directed a claim against 
Apirsa, Boliden BV and Boliden AB for alleged clean-up costs in 
connection with the accident  This claim, amounting to close to 
EUR 90 m, was tried by the First Instance Court no  11 of Seville  
In its judgement issued in July 2023, the Court fully dismissed the 
Junta’s claim and imposed the legal costs for the proceedings on 
the Junta  The decision has been appealed by the Junta to the next 
instance  
Apirsa initiated insolvency proceedings in January 2005, for an 
orderly coordinated closure of the company  In the context of the 
insolvency procedures, the receivers had requested that Apirsa’s 
parent company, Boliden BV, Boliden Mineral AB and Boliden AB 
be held liable for the deficit in Apirsa’s estate, in total allegedly just 
over EUR 147 m, including the above-mentioned fine of EUR 45 m 
and the Junta’s disputed claim of close to EUR 90 m  The insol-
vency proceedings have been on hold for several years pending 
the determination of the Junta’s claim  
The companies that were responsible for the design and construc-
tion of the dams, and against which Apirsa had previously brought 
suits and lost, are entitled to reimbursement for their legal costs  
It is currently not possible to assess whether the claims for these 
legal costs can be brought against any Boliden company other 
than Apirsa 
Based on the legal advice and opinions given by the company’s 
Spanish legal counsel, Boliden’s overall view is that the company 
will not suffer any substantial financial loss as a result of the legal 
proceedings described  The company has made no provision, 
pending final rulings  
Disputes regarding Boliden Kevitsa Oy’s tax reassessment for 
the years 2012–2016
The Finnish Tax Authorities reassessed Boliden Kevitsa Oy’s 
taxation for the years 2012 to 2016, which resulted in increased 
tax expenses of EUR 34 m (including interest and penalties)  The 
­
reassessment was attributable to reorganizations prior to Boliden’s 
acquisition of Kevitsa from First Quantum Minerals (FQM)  
Boliden has paid in all relevant amounts to the Finnish tax author-
ity and has demanded that FQM indemnifies Boliden for any 
losses that Boliden has incurred as a result of the increased tax 
assessment  
After the final and binding conclusion of various legal proceed-
ings in Finland and in Canada during 2023, in January 2024, FQM 
fulfilled its indemnification obligation by transferring the disputed 
amounts, in total EUR 36 7 m (including capital amount and inter-
est) to Boliden, bringing the tax matter and the commercial dispute 
to final resolve  The claim had been activated on Boliden’s Balance 
Sheet and therefore receipt of the indemnification payment has 
no financial impact besides a positive cashflow effect in the first 
quarter of 2024

Proposed allocation of profits
The Board’s proposed allocation of profits for 2023 and 
statement in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, 18:4
Boliden’s dividend policy requires approximately one-third of 
the profit after tax to be disbursed in the form of dividends  The 
Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 
approve payment of a dividend of SEK 7 50 (15 00) per share or a 
total of SEK 2,051 m (4,103), corresponding to 33 8 percent of the 
profit after tax for 2023  The Parent Company’s non-restricted 
equity totals SEK 10,758 m and the Group’s total equity SEK 56,404 
m  After payment of the proposed dividend to shareholders, the 
non-restricted equity in the Parent Company and the Group will 
total SEK 8,707 m and SEK 54,353 m, respectively  The Board has 
taken the cyclical nature of the industry and the risks associated 
with the operations into account in its dividend proposal 
The remaining non-restricted equity in the Parent Company will be 
carried forward

Auditor’s Report
To the general meeting of the shareholders of Boliden AB 
(publ), corporate identity number 556051-4142
REPORT ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS
Opinions
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
of Boliden AB (publ) for the financial year 2023-01-01 – 2023-12-31, except for the corporate governance statement on 
pages 66-77 and the statutory sustainability report on pages 8–11, 
14–15, 22, 26–27, 30–41, 53–57, 71–72 and 122–127  The annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included 
on pages 8–11, 18–24, 26–27, 30–47 and 53–116 in this document  
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in 
accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of parent company as of 
31 December 2023 and its financial performance and cash flow 
for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts 
Act  The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance 
with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 
2023 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year 
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts 
Act  Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance state-
ment on pages 66-77 and the statutory sustainability report on 
pages 8–11, 14–15, 22, 26–27, 30–41, 53–57, 71–72 and 122–127  The 
statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts 
of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
We therefore recommend that the general meeting of sharehold-
ers adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent 
company and the group 
Our opinions in this report on the the annual accounts and consol-
idated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional 
report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit 
committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) 
Article 11 
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section  We 
are independent of the parent company and the group in accor-
dance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have 
otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements  This includes that, based on the best of our 
knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the 
Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5 1 have been provided to the 
audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its 
controlled companies within the EU 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Key Audit Matters 
Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our pro-
fessional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period  
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and 
in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and con-
solidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate 
opinion on these matters  
Estimates of provisions for reclamation costs
The group has commitments for reclamation of closed mines and 
for reclamation costs that are expected to arise for mines when 
the mine operations are decommissioned  The provision for these 
commitments is judgmental and dependent on several factors 
including cost estimates for different reclamation measures, life 
of mine, regulatory decisions, and discount rates  Any changes in 
these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on 
the group’s earnings and financial position 
The group’s accounting principles for reclamation provisions, this 
year’s change in capitalized reclamation costs, and the group’s 
reclamation provisions are described in note 2, 14 and 25 
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: −review of accounting policy for reclamation provisions for com-
pliance with IFRS, −evaluating the group’s controls to account for reclamation 
provisions, and −review of assumptions used to estimate the reclamation pro-
visions for consistency with approved production plans, life of 
mines expectancies, and discount rates 
Recognition of revenues from sales of metals at the 
­
appropriate price and in the correct period
The group’s sales of metals are to a large extent priced in US 
dollars and sales are often made to predetermined terms  
Individual sales transactions may represent significant amounts  
Taken together, this requires good procedures to ensure that 
revenues are recognized at agreed terms and that revenues are 
recognized in the correct period  
The group’s accounting principles for revenue recognition and the 
group’s revenues by geographical area and product category are 
described in note 4 
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: −review of the group’s accounting policy for revenue recognition 
for compliance with IFRS, −evaluating the group’s controls for recognizing revenues at 
appropriate prices and in the correct accounting period, −analysis of revenues by metal based on sales volumes, metal 
prices and exchange rates, and −on a sample basis testing of sales transactions against sales 
contracts, invoices and shipping documents to assess that 
revenues are recognized at appropriate prices and in the correct 
accounting period 
Valuation of inventory
The group’s inventory consists primarily of metal concentrate, 
materials tied up in the smelter’s production process and finished 
metal  The group’s accounting and valuation of inventory is 
complex and requires judgment about stock levels, metal content, 
metal prices, exchange rates and internal profits 
| Auditor’s Report
Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
117
Financial reports
The group’s accounting principles for valuation of inventory and a 
breakdown of the group’s inventory, are described in note 2 and 19 
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: −review of the group’s valuation policy for inventory and its 
compliance with IFRS, −assessing the group’s controls for inventory valuation, −observations of physical inventory counts, −on a sample basis testing that the inventory has been valued at 
current metal prices and exchange rates, −review of the process inventory revaluation and eliminations of 
intragroup profits in inventory 
Accounting and valuation of financial instruments
The group is exposed to changes in metal prices, exchange rates 
and interest rates  To reduce its exposure in larger investment 
projects and in contracted purchase and sales commitments the 
group uses various types of financial instruments, including deriv-
atives  The group also manages its exposure to changes in interest 
rates by reducing or extending the interest duration period via 
interest rate swaps  The accounting for financial instruments is 
complex and may have significant impact on the group’s earnings 
and financial position 
For the group’s financial risks and management of these risks, 
please refer to page 56-57 and note 26, 27, 28 and 29 for the group’s 
principles for the valuation of financial instruments and for the 
group’s financial derivatives 
Our audit procedures
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: −review of the group’s financial policy and hedging strategies −review of hedging activities to ensure that these have been 
properly authorized and accounted for in accordance with IFRS, 
and −review of the relevance of market data and methodologies used 
to determine fair value of derivative contracts 
Valuation of intangible and tangible assets 
The group’s intangible and tangible assets represent significant 
amounts  Impairment testing of these assets is based on produc-
tion plans, which in turn are based on assumptions about future 
metal prices, treatment and refining charges, and exchange rates  
Changes in these assumptions have a significant impact on the 
group’s future cash flows and thus the estimated recoverable 
amount of intangible and tangible assets and any potential impair-
ment needs  
The group’s principles to prepare impairment tests for intangible 
and tangible assets and significant assumptions applied in the 
impairment tests are described in note 2, 13 and 14  
Our audit procedures 
Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to: −review of the group’s process and principles for preparing 
impairment tests for compliance with IFRS, −evaluation of key assumptions such as estimated life of mines, 
production plans, metal prices, treatment and refining charges, 
and exchange rates and the sensitivity in these assumptions to 
any changes, and −review of the model used to discount future cash flows for 
arithmetical correctness 
Other Information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts
The other information consists of the remuneration report as well 
as the pages 1–7, 12–13, 16–17, 25, 48–52, 58–65 and 128–141  The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible 
for this other information  We expect to obtain the remuneration 
report after the date ot this audit report 
Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
does not cover this other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information 
In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information iden-
tified above and consider whether the information is materially 
inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  
In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge oth-
erwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated 
If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other infor-
mation, we are required to report that fact  We have nothing to 
report in this regard  
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsi-
ble for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance 
with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated 
accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU  The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error 
In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible 
for the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern  They disclose, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting  The going concern basis of accounting is however 
not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director 
intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no 
realistic alternative but to do so 
The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of 
Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things 
oversee the company’s financial reporting process 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions  Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists  Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence 
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts 
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise profes-
sional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout 
the audit  We also: −Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures respon-
sive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient

and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions  The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control  Obtain an understanding of 
the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circum-
stances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the company’s internal control  −Obtain an understanding of the company’s internal control 
relevant to our audit in order to design audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose 
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control  −Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used 
and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related 
disclosures made by the Board of Directors and the Managing 
Director  −Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ 
and the Managing Director’s use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual accounts and consolidat-
ed accounts  We also draw a conclusion, based on the audit 
evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going 
concern  If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are 
required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion 
about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report  However, future events or condi-
tions may cause a company and a group to cease to continue as 
a going concern  −Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the 
disclosures, and whether the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a 
manner that achieves fair presentation  −Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the 
financial information of the entities or business activities within 
the group to express an opinion on the consolidated accounts  
We are responsible for the direction, supervision and perfor-
mance of the group audit  We remain solely responsible for our 
opinions  
We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit  We must also inform of 
significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identified 
We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that 
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding 
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships 
and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our 
independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate 
threats or safeguards applied 
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we 
determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including 
the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and 
are therefore the key audit matters  We describe these matters in 
the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure 
about the matter 
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY ­
REQUIREMENTS
Opinions
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director of Boliden AB (publ) for the 
financial year 2023-01-01 – 2023-12-31 and the proposed appro-
priations of the company’s profit or loss 
We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the 
profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the stat-
utory administration report and that the members of the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability 
for the financial year 
Basis for Opinions
We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
section  We are independent of the parent company and the 
group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in 
Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing 
Director
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appro-
priations of the company’s profit or loss  At the proposal of a 
dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is 
justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s and 
the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the size 
of the parent company’s and the group’s equity, consolidation 
requirements, liquidity and position in general 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organiza-
tion and the administration of the company’s affairs  This includes 
among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and 
the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s 
organization is designed so that the accounting, management of 
assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled 
in a reassuring manner  The Managing Director shall manage 
the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ 
guidelines and instructions and among other matters take 
measures that are necessary to fulfill the company’s accounting 
in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a 
reassuring manner 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and 
thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain 
audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance 
whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing 
Director in any material respect: −has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which 
can give rise to liability to the company, or −in any other way has acted in contravention of the ­
Companies 
Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association 
Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropri-
ations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion 
about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance 
whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions 
or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that 
the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are 
not in accordance with the Companies Act 
Boliden Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
119
As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit  The exam-
ination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of 
the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the 
accounts  Additional audit procedures performed are based on 
our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materi-
ality  This means that we focus the examination on such actions, 
areas and relationships that are material for the operations and 
where deviations and violations would have particular impor-
tance for the company’s situation  We examine and test decisions 
undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other cir-
cumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge 
from liability  As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ 
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we exam-
ined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and a selection 
of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess whether the 
proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act 
THE AUDITORS’S EXAMINATION OF THE ESEF REPORT
Opinion
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also examined that the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts in a format that enables uniform electronic 
reporting (the Esef report) pursuant to Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of 
the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528) for Boliden AB (publ) 
for the financial year 2023-01-01 – 2023-12-31  
Our examination and our opinion relate only to the statutory 
requirements  
In our opinion, the Esef report has been prepared in a format that, 
in all material respects, enables uniform electronic reporting 
Basis for opinion
We have performed the examination in accordance with FAR’s 
recommendation RevR 18 Examination of the Esef report  Our 
responsibility under this recommendation is described in more 
detail in the Auditors’ responsibility section  We are independent 
of Boliden AB (publ) in accordance with professional ethics for 
accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements  
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are respon-
sible for the preparation of the Esef report in accordance with 
the Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market 
Act (2007:528), and for such internal control that the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director determine is necessary to 
prepare the Esef report without material misstatements, whether 
due to fraud or error 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the 
Esef report is in all material respects prepared in a format that 
meets the requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4a of the Swedish 
Securities Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures 
performed 
RevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve 
reasonable assurance that the Esef report is prepared in a format 
that meets these requirements  
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a 
guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 
and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists  Misstatements can 
arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the 
Esef report  
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 
1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
The examination involves obtaining evidence, through various 
procedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format 
that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts  The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error  
In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor 
considers those elements of internal control that are relevant to 
the preparation of the Esef report by the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  The exam-
ination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and 
reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors 
and the Managing Director  
The procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report 
has been prepared in a valid XHMTL format and a reconciliation of 
the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts 
Furthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of 
whether the consolidated statement of financial performance, 
financial position, changes in equity, cash flow and disclosures in

and 122–127, and that it is prepared in accordance with the Annual 
Accounts Act  
Our examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR:s 
auditing standard RevR 12 The auditor´s opinion regarding the

Report on sustainable financing
Green Finance Framework
As part of Boliden’s strategy, and to further integrate our sustain-
ability commitments with Boliden’s financing activities, a Green 
Finance Framework was established in May 2022 which will enable 
Boliden to issue Green Bonds and Green Loans  The Green Finance 
Framework provides investors transparency on how they are 
contributing to Boliden’s vision to be the most climate friendly and 
respected metal provider in the world  
Financing under the framework is earmarked for projects and 
investments within energy efficiency, pollution prevention and 
control, research and development, and clean transportation  
Examples of important projects that could be financed under the 
framework include energy and heat recovery, process and mine 
electrification, water purification, waste reduction and extraction 
of metal from residual and recycled materials  
The framework has undergone an independent external review 
by CICERO Shades of Green, now part of S&P, who have classified 
the framework as “CICERO Medium green” with an “Excellent” 
governance score and assessed it to be in alignment with the 
International Capital Market Association Green Bond Principles 
and the Loan Market Association Green Loan Principles 
Governance and selection process
To ensure transparency and accountability around the selection 
of investments to be financed under the framework, Boliden has 
established a cross-departmental Sustainable Finance Committee 
(SFC), being responsible for the evaluation and selection process  
The SFC ensures that only such assets and projects that comply 
with the Green Project categories defined in the Framework are 
eligible to be financed  Examples of other eligibility criteria are 
satisfactory outcome of ESG risk evaluation and CO2 lock-in effect 
assessment 
Green Bond issue 
In addition to the Green Bonds that Boliden issued during 2022, 
new Green Bonds amounting to NOK 1 4 billion were issued 
during 2023  The financing supports the expansion investments 
in Boliden Odda with the aim of increasing zinc production with a 
low climate footprint  The bonds were issued under Boliden’s MTN 
program and are listed on Nasdaq’s Sustainable Bonds list (SEK) 
and Oslo Børs (NOK)  
Examples of Green Projects financed under the framework 
The expansion of Boliden Odda
Proceeds from the Green bonds issued in 2022 and 2023 are 
allocated to Boliden’s expansion of the world’s most climate 
effective zinc smelter in Odda, Norway  The expansion means that 
the production of zinc with world-leading climate performance 
will almost double  The increased production capacity, together 
with improved energy efficiency and a new long-term contract 
for the supply of fossil-free electricity, means a further reduc-
tion in the already low carbon dioxide intensity  The investment 
includes several new facilities at Boliden Odda, including a new 
roaster, a new sulphuric acid plant, expansion and modernization 
of the leaching and the purification plant, a new cellhouse and 
expansion of the foundry and quay infrastructure  The investment 
is planned for a total of EUR 850 million and scheduled for com-
pletion during 2024

Impact report
IInvestments funded under Boliden’s Green Finance Framework 
intend to bring energy efficiency improvements with the aim of 
reducing energy consumption (in absolute or relative terms) by 
using best available technology and beyond in the targeted area, 
and or significantly reduce pollution to water and air, as well as the 
reduction, recycling, recovery and reuse of waste  An important 
selection criterion is also that investments be in line with Boliden’s 
roadmap to achieve the target of 42% reduction in CO2 emissions 
by 2030 and the long term goal of net zero carbon emissions in 
Scopes 1 and 2 by 2050 
In relation to the issued Green Bonds allocated for the expansion 
of Boliden Odda, the investments are in line with Boliden’s CO2 
roadmap and are intended to increase production capacity of low 
carbon zinc while reducing the electrical energy intensity by 5% 
and waste intensity by 30%  The outcome of the targets will be 
reported once the expansion is completed and the new facilities 
are up and running 
Auditor’s Limited Assurance Report on Boliden AB’s 
Sustainable Finance Report
Introduction
We have been engaged by Boliden AB (publ) (“Boliden”) to under-
take a limited assurance engagement of Boliden’s Sustainable 
Finance Report (“Reporting”) for the year 2023 set out in this 
document on pages 122–123 
Responsibilities of Management
Boliden Management is responsible for the preparation of the 
Reporting in accordance with the applicable criteria, as explained 
in Boliden’s Green Finance Framework May 2022 (available at 
https://www boliden com/investor-relations/financials/debt- 
structure) as well as the accounting and calculation principles that 
the Company has developed  This responsibility also includes the 
internal control relevant to the preparation of the Reporting that is 
free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error  
Responsibilities of the auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Reporting 
based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed  
Our engagement is limited to historical information presented and 
does therefore not cover future-oriented information 	
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance 
with ISAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information  A limited assurance 
engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for the preparation of the Reporting, and applying 
analytical and other limited assurance procedures  The procedures 
performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature from, 
and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engage-
ment conducted in accordance with International Standards on 
Auditing and other generally accepted auditing standards in 
Sweden 
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 
1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements  We 
are independent of Boliden in accordance with professional ethics 
for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
The procedures performed consequently do not enable us to 
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance 
engagement  
Accordingly, the conclusion of the procedures performed do not 
express a reasonable assurance conclusion 
Our procedures are based on the criteria defined by Boliden 
Management as described above  We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Reporting 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below 
Conclusion
Based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
the Reporting for the year 2023, is not prepared, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria, as explained in 
Boliden’s Green Finance Framework May 2022

Report on sustainable financing
EU Taxonomy
The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that helps companies 
and investors identify environmentally sustainable economic 
activities to make sustainable investment decisions  It aims to 
scale up investments in projects and activities that are necessary 
to reach the objectives of the European Green Deal – the plan 
to make the EU’s economy environmentally sustainable  The 
Taxonomy Regulation sets out six environmental objectives and 
four overarching conditions that an economic activity must meet 
in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable 
The EU Taxonomy does not set mandatory requirements on 
environmental performance for companies or for financial prod-
ucts  Investors are free to choose what to invest in  However, it is 
expected that over time, the EU Taxonomy will encourage a transi-
tion towards sustainability in order to achieve the EU’s climate and 
environmental goals  
Through delegated acts EU sets performance criteria (so called 
“technical screening criteria”) for activities covered by the EU 
Taxonomy to determine, when an economic activity substantially 
contributes to one of the environmental objectives, while not 
doing significant harm to any of the other five objectives  
Boliden is required to disclose to what extent our activities are 
covered by the EU Taxonomy (i e , if they are Taxonomy-eligible) 
and comply with the criteria set in the Taxonomy delegated 
acts (i e , if they are Taxonomy-aligned) and disclose our related 
revenue, Opex and Capex amounts  
Since our mines and smelters are not yet included in the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation, only a small part of Boliden’s operations 
within logistics, real estate and water treatment are taxonomy- 
eligible, see further below 
Boliden is aware of initiatives that have been taken to include 
non-ferrous mining and or smelting in the EU Taxonomy and to 
develop technical screening criteria to evaluate the sustainability 
of such activities  So far, none of these initiatives have resulted in 
legislation  Given the increasing recognition of the importance of 
sustainable metal production - both for the green transition and 
for EU’s strategic autonomy – it would be reasonable to expect 
mining and smelting to be included in the EU Taxonomy 
Relevant economic activities The analysis of which of Boliden’s economic activities are in scope 
of the EU Taxonomy was carried out on a company-by-com-
pany basis using the descriptions of taxonomy-eligible activities 
included in the regulation to identify eligible activities  
The proportion of Boliden’s economic activities that are taxono-
my-eligible in 2023 is shown in the tables on the following pages  
As Boliden’s core business is not eligible, no revenue has been 
identified to be eligible  Hence, the below activities have been 
identified as relevant for Boliden in 2023 from either a Capex 
or Opex perspective  Eligibility is based on primarily the climate 
change mitigation objective  
The Capex and Opex reported represents the proportion of capital 
and operational expenditures associated with taxonomy-eligible 
economic activities or related to the acquisition of products or ser-
vices from taxonomy-eligible economic activities  When it comes 
to reporting of eligible investments, the focus has been to review 
the largest projects per site to assess taxonomy-eligibility  For all 
the Taxonomy-eligible activities Boliden has identified, none have 
been determined to be taxonomy-aligned

1)	 The figures for 2023 comprise proposed dividend 
2)	 The figures for 2021 and 2022 have been restated due to an update of the reporting calendar 
3)	 CO2-intensity is the relationship between the total carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) and the total production of metal in concentrate from mines and metal pro-
duction from smelters 
4)	 The Natural Capital Protocol method has been used since 2019 to calculate metal equivalents  The period 2014– 2018 refers to metal equivalents (tonnes)

1)	 Business acquisitions: Kylylahti 2014 (SEK 718 m), Kevitsa 2016 (SEK 5,961 m) 
2)	 The figures for 2021 and 2022 have been restated due to an update of the reporting calendar 
3) CO2-intensity in mines is the relationship between total carbon dioxide emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) and the metal content of concentrate produced from mines 
4)	 The acquisition of Kylylahti was completed in October 2014  The mine was mined for the last time in November 2020 
5)	 Due to incorrect calculation data, Garpenberg’s figure for Ag g/tonne in 2017 has been corrected from 113 to 133 
6)	 The acquisition of Kevitsa was completed in June 2016

Definition cash margin
Boliden uses Wood Mackenzie’s cash margin metric to 
measure the cost position of our smelters in relation to 
other smelters globally  Cash margin is the difference 
between revenue and cash cost and is expressed in USc/
lb metal  The income comprises treatment and refining 
charges, free metals and income from by-products  
For zinc smelters, the sales of sulphuric acid is included in 
the revenue, while it is a credit in the cash cost calculation 
for copper smelters  The revenue from sales of surplus 
energy is calculated as a credit against cash cost 
The calculations for copper smelters are expressed as unit 
of metal produced from concentrate, while for zinc smelters 
it is expressed as unit of finished metal produced  Income 
is normally included if it is regarded as having been derived 
from the main process during the production of metal and 
the product is saleable 
Definition cash cost
Boliden uses the Wood Mackenzie’s cash cost metrics, C1 
Normal costing and C1 Pro rata costing, to measure the cost 
position of our mines in relation to other mines worldwide  
The lower a mine’s cash cost, the better its cost position  
Cash cost is expressed in USc/lb of metal and can be mul-
tiplied by 22 0462 (rounded) to obtain the price in USD per 
tonne of metal 
Normal costing
In normal costing calculations, the costs are allocated in 
their entirety to one main metal and then reduced by the 
net revenue1) of other metals, known as by-products 
+
Mining operations, concentration and adminis-
tration costs 2)
+
Costs of freighting concentrate to smelters
+
Treatment and refining charges (TC/RC)
–
Deductions for net revenue of by-metals
Cash cost C1 Normal costing
Pro rata costing
In pro rata cash costing, the costs are divided between the 
various metals on the basis of the individual metal’s share of 
the total net revenue 
Composite costing
In composite costing, mines are included using either 
normal costing or pro rata costing on the basis of criteria 
based on the metals’ net revenue  If a metal accounts for 
65% or more of the total net revenue, the cash cost is calcu-
lated using normal costing  If not, the cash cost is calculated 
using pro rata costing

posed of two or more chemical elements, at least one of 
which is a metal  
Base metals  Some of the most common metals that are 
non-ferrous or non-precious  Examples are zinc, copper, 
lead, nickel and aluminum 
Cash cost  Common measurement used to show the costs 
affecting a mine’s cash flow  Used to compare the cost posi-
tion between mines  See definition on previous page 
Complex ore  Ore that contains several metals, for example 
zinc, copper, lead, gold and silver, and or deleterious 
elements 
Concentrator  A plant in which ore is processed mechan-
ically and or chemically to extract and produce a concen-
trate of the valuable minerals

product in the form of 99 percent pure copper plates 
that can be further refined into copper cathodes through 
electrolysis  
Copper cathode  An end product from copper smelters in 
the form of 99 9975 percent pure copper plates 
Feed  A smelter’s raw material input, i e , the amount

metal refinery 
Jarosite  A mineral primarily comprising iron sulfate, which 
is a common waste product of zinc production 
Kaldo furnace  Rotating and tippable furnace for the 
smelting and process treatment of copper, lead and 
­
precious metals, etc , including the recycling of metals from 
electronic scrap  The plastic present in the scrap is used as a 
fuel, thereby reducing the process energy requirement 
Metal equivalents  In a sustainability context, a metric 
used to describe the environmental impact of emissions 
and discharges of metals to air and water, respectively  The 
metal equivalent (Me-eq) takes into account the toxicity of 
each metal (relative to Cu) and provides a better metric of 
the environmental impact than the combined weight of the 
metals 
Metal concentrate  Also known as dressed ore or mined 
concentrate  Metal concentrate is the result of the con-
centration processes that separate the financially valuable 
minerals present in ore from those with no financial value  
Metal content  The quantities of for example zinc, copper, 
lead, gold and silver contained in concentrates  Zinc 
concentrates generally contain approximately 50 percent 
zinc metal, while copper concentrates generally contain 
approximately 25 percent copper  The lead content of 
mined concentrate is usually around 65 percent 
Metal premium  The price agreed in advance, over and 
above the LME price, and paid by customers for specifically 
customized metals delivered free of charge 
Mineral reserves  Those parts of a mineral resource that 
can be mined and processed in accordance with the compa-
ny’s profitability requirements, taking into account factors 
such as waste rock dilution and the percentage of metal in 
an ore that can be extracted in the concentration process, 
are transferred to mineral reserves and hence eliminated 
from the mineral resources  Mineral reserves are divided 
into two categories: proven mineral reserves and probable 
mineral reserves 
Mineral resource  A concentration of minerals in the 
bedrock that may become commercially extractable  
Mineral resources are divided into three categories: mea-
sured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources and 
inferred mineral resources 
Mineralization  A concentration of minerals in the 
bedrock  
Nickel matte  An intermediate product made from smelt-

nickel but also other metals such as copper, cobalt, and pre-
cious metals  The various metals present in the nickel matte 
are then separated into pure metals in a nickel refinery 
Open pit  Method of mining mineral deposits located near 
the surface  The waste rock is stripped, and the ore mined 
directly at the surface 
Ore  Economic term for minerals, rock types or other 
bedrock components that can be profitably mined to 
extract metals or other valuable substances 
Ore grade  The average quantity of valuable metals in a 
tonne of ore, expressed as grams per tonne for precious 
metals and as a percentage for other metals 
Payable metal content  The percentage of the metal 
content of the concentrate for which the smelters pay when 
purchasing concentrate 
PGMs  Platinum-group metals are six noble, precious 
metallic elements clustered together in the periodic table  
These include ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, 
iridium and platinum  
Precious metals  Metals that are less commonly present in 
the earth’s crust than base metals and which are regarded, 
to a greater extent, as a type of investment asset by financial 
sector players  The most common precious metals are gold, 
silver, platinum and palladium 
Price escalators or de-escalators (PP)  Also known as 
price-participation clauses  The clauses in the agreements 
for treatment charges that distribute changes in metal 
prices between mines and smelters  Most commonly for 
zinc treatmeant charges
