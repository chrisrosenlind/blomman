comprises pages 8–11, 14–15, 18–24, 26–27, 30–47, 53–57, and 
66–77  Boliden’s Sustainability Report as required by Chapter 6, 
section 11 of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, is presented on 
pages 8–11, 14–15, 22, 26–27, 30–41, 53–57, 71–72 and 122–127  
Thanks to its excellent ability to conduct electricity, more 
than 60 percent of the copper produced in the world is 
used to generate or conduct electricity, for example in 
More than two thirds of the world’s nickel production is 
used in making stainless steel  Nickel is also an important 
Steel is galvanized with the help of zinc to protect the 
conditions  Therefore, zinc is used in for example wind

Combined CO2e emissions from own operations (Scope 1) and purchased electricity, steam and heat (Scope 2)  
“I do not think one should hide the fact that we have expe-
rienced a year that has been challenging in several ways  
After a strong beginning, the prices of many base metals fell 
from February onwards, due to economic slowdown in large 
parts of the world, while Covid-19 recovery in China was 
weaker than expected  This has affected our revenues for 
the year, mainly within Business Area Mines  In addition, we 
faced operational challenges in our own businesses ”
Which events are especially important to highlight?
“A very important parameter for heavy industries in general 
is that the major investments carried out follow the time 
schedule and budget  For us, 2023 was a year of historically 
large investments and we have of course dedicated a lot 
of energy to the investments at Aitik, the Boliden Area and 
Odda  These three projects are proceeding according to our 
plans and will be largely completed by 2024–2025  By then, 
zinc production in Odda – with world leading technology 
and sustainability performance – will have almost doubled  
Aitik’s tailings pond will have a reinforced dam structure, 
enabling future deposition, while production in the Boliden 
Area will be more climate-friendly  On top of this, it should 
be highlighted that we during the year inaugurated the new 
port infrastructure for Harjavalta, enabling us to handle 
Turning to the challenges we have faced, I would like to 
emphasize the fire at the Rönnskär smelter and the decision 
to place the operation at our Irish Tara mine under care and 
maintenance  For both of these very difficult incidents, we 
have effectively taken action to minimize the consequences 
and at Rönnskär, we are especially grateful to have avoided 
physical harm to our co-workers  In both cases, we work 
on restarting operations, at Rönnskär through a feasibil-
ity study for a new tank house and at Tara by identifying 
conditions for a restart in 2024 with long-term sustainable 
What is your view on the development of operations 
“Our strategy is to continuously develop productivity, while 
in parallel identifying investments that strengthen our 
competitiveness and take us towards our vision of being the 
most climate-friendly and respected metal provider in the 
world  At the start of the year, we were able to communi-
cate good exploration results from the Garpenberg mine, 
which in turn made the foundation for conceptual studies 
on how to expand production  In Aitik, we have piloted 
autonomous mine trucks and within Business Area Smelters 
we have increased our offering of metals with a low-carbon 
Towards the end of the year, our climate targets were vali-
dated and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, 
making Boliden one of very few companies globally within 
our sector to be given this recognition  I consider this an 
important proof of us being at the forefront of developing 
a long-term responsible mining and metals industry  These 
are just a few examples of how we continue to develop 
our competitiveness with the metal markets of tomorrow 
in mind  By clear delegation of responsibility within the 
organization, similar work is taking place at all our units 
and in the same way we are making significant efforts to 
strengthen our common safety culture  In this area too, the 
performance has been good, with the lowest Loss Time 
“Our assessment is that the current content of our metal 
portfolio is beneficial in the long term  Many of the metals, 
such as copper and nickel, will be demanded in much larger 
quantities for the expansion of energy infrastructure and 
the implementation of fossil fuel-free technologies within 
several areas  We will therefore continue to invest in explo-
ration, both adjacent to our current mining units and in new 
geographies  One example of a project in a new geography 
is Laver, where our ambition is to submit a renewed applica-
tion for mining concession during autumn 2024  In addition, 
we will continue to develop operations at our existing sites 
within both our business areas through projects that can 
contribute to higher productivity and strengthened com-
petitiveness  One should keep in mind that also 2024 is a 
year of large investments, so naturally we will have a signif-
icant focus on, among other things, that the ramping up of 
production levels at Odda will proceed according to plan  
Boliden turns 100 years in 2024  This will of course be 
celebrated and serves as a reminder that long-term value is 
created from actual conditions and that execution of small, 
continuous improvements often are equally important 
as large, one-of-a-kind projects  Last but maybe most 
important of all, I look forward to, just like this year, together 
with all my talented and ambitious colleagues, continuing 
to drive and develop our business and workplaces  It is 
through our decentralized corporate culture combined with 
skilled and responsible co-workers that we will shape the 
success of tomorrow and continue our evolution towards a 
Societal development has long relied on metals due 
to their durability and ability to conduct electricity and 
heat  As an enabler of the climate transition, demand 
becoming a topic of strategic importance for Europe 
Metals and minerals are important for almost every aspect 
of our daily lives  They play a vital role in everything from
agriculture, healthcare, communications, water and energy 
supply, transport and space technology to the construction
of our cities  Without metals, our modern lives would simply 
Boliden produces many of the metals that are critical for the 
climate transition  Copper is necessary for generation,
transmission and storage of energy, and thus needed for 
electricity grids and electrical and electronic equipment  
Zinc is used to galvanize steel, which protects against 
corrosion and thereby, for example, extends the lifespan of 
offshore windfarms that are exposed to harsh conditions  
Up to 40 kilograms of nickel can be needed for the battery 
of a single electric car, while it also uses smaller lead-based 
Metal circularity is an increasingly important aspect for 
companies and consumers as they make decisions based 
on total life cycle costs  Boliden recycles large volumes of 
copper, zinc and lead from electronics, steel mill dust and 
batteries  Recycled metal is growing in importance to the 
overall supply, but is not sufficient to meet demand and 
metals in many applications will not become available for 
recycling for decades  For example, power lines may have a 
Fossil fuels typically play a large direct role in metal pro-
duction and are in many countries also used indirectly to 
generate electricity needed  Other challenges facing the 
industry include the management of waste, access to water, 
reclamation of old operational sites as well as human rights  
Europe is often a forerunner in dealing with these issues 
through more stringent permit requirements for mining and 
Boliden strives to be the industry benchmark in all matters 
related to sustainability and acceptance from authorities, 
local communities and other stakeholders is vital to gain the 
required permits to continue operations  In global terms, we 
have among the lowest carbon footprints through innovative 
solutions and good access to fossil fuel-free energy  Read 
more about our sustainability management on pages 14–15  
Around the world, the mining industry is an important 
source of job opportunities both directly and indirectly 
through its investments and purchase of goods and ser-
vices  In Sweden, an estimated 7,400 people are employed 
directly by metal mining companies and 750 people in 
industrial mineral companies  A job in the mining industry 
creates 1 8 indirect jobs at the subcontractor level  This in 
turn creates further job opportunities in supermarkets, 
restaurants, culture and public services – all in all contribut-
Metal production is also a major source of tax revenue for 
both the state and the sparsely populated areas where such 
companies operate  In some countries, mining companies 
account for more than 20 percent of total tax revenue  In
2023, Boliden paid SEK 1,763 million (2,815) in corporate tax 
in its operating countries, excluding social security contribu-
In light of the above, demand for metals is expected to 
increase with urbanization, prosperity and climate-friendly 
technologies  For the base metals that Boliden produces, 
Wood McKenzie estimates demand increases of 75 percent 
for copper, 48 percent for zinc, 74 percent for lead and 94 
Access to metal is thus essential to societal progress and 
over-reliance on individual countries for supply has become 
a strategic risk  Accordingly, the European Commission in 
2023 defined updated lists of critical and strategic metals 
– including for example copper and nickel – with specific 
requirements for both European production and reliance on 
Our excellent technical know-how combined with good 
access to fossil fuel-free electricity together make for 
manufacturing processes with world-class productivity and 
environmental performance  Regardless, Boliden has set 
the target of reducing absolute carbon dioxide emissions by 
42 percent by 2030, with 2021 as the base year  We extract 
metals from both ore concentrates and secondary materi-
als and take responsibility for the entire supply chain  The 
sustainability-focused partnerships we build with customers 
form an important local value chain in northern Europe  
Boliden is a leader in the development of methods for the 
reclamation of closed mines and the disposal of hazardous 
waste  We are working with the development of proactive 
risk management and increased involvement in occupational 
health and safety issues to improve safety for employees 
and contractors alike  Boliden is an active member of the 
leading industry organizations whose aim is to improve 
occupational health and safety in the mining and smelting 
Boliden provides the metals needed to improve society for 
future generations  The main metals are copper, zinc, nickel 
and lead, which are all important for a sustainable society  
Copper and nickel are crucial for increased electrification  
Lead is used in the storage of electricity, and zinc is neces-
sary for improving corrosion protection, thereby reducing 
resource utilization  Boliden’s by-products include gold, 
silver, platinum and palladium  Gold is of great importance 
for the stability of global financial markets, while platinum 
All in all, our multi-faceted product portfolio makes us well-
equipped for the opportunities and challenges we face in 
Boliden has both the expertise and financial position to 
Our employees carry a valuable cultural heritage of almost a 
century of experience from mining and smelting operations  
The value chain from mines to smelters creates synergies 
between the business areas and increases stability in the 
Group’s earnings potential  This stability is reinforced by 
the tendency of treatment charges to move in the opposite 
direction to variable base metal prices  Over time, precious 
metal prices also tend to have a negative correlation to 
those of base metals, and this increases the stability of the 
Group’s earnings potential  Production takes place in north-
ern Europe, where political risk is low  Project management 
is run in-house with a focus on safety, production stability 
Boliden strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet and has 
defined financial targets that are adapted to prepare for 
Boliden’s most important mines have long lifespans and 
the focus lies on mine-site exploration where the economic 
potential is the greatest  Acquisitions are made selectively, if 
“The ecological compensation in Sarkanenä park is the 
result of a collaboration between Boliden, the Swedish 
University of Agricultural Sciences and the land owner 
Sveaskog  The forest here is old but has thus far lacked the 
characteristics of ancient woodland  The re-creation of 
structures typical for ancient woodland has been prioritized 
What is the main purpose of our Sustainability Parks?
“The Sustainability Parks form a part of our ambition to, in 
return for what we have borrowed, give something back to 
both society and nature  They highlight the sites’ history 
and biodiversity, and our presence today, yesterday and 
tomorrow  We invite the public to experience how we work 
with ecological reclamation and compensation but also with 
other sustainability aspects like climate and traditional Sami 
Are there any other parks in the pipeline and what characteristics will they have?
“All of Boliden’s Sustainability Parks will be unique as they 
are created in harmony with the natural characteristics of 
the site  However, there are some commonalities: all parks 
will have a shelter, information signs in multiple languages 
and signs specially designed to address the curiosity of 
children  There will always be a focus on biodiversity and on 
informing the public about this  The guiding words for the 
creation of the parks are responsible, playful, innovative and 
accessible and these should be reflected in the experience 
of park visitors  As for other parks in the pipeline, there are 
many sites we envision for future parks and our ambition is 
Near Aitik, we have inaugurated our first Sustainability 
Park – a place where locals and tourists can enjoy, and learn 
about, the beautiful nature and rich biodiversity around our

The return on investments shall be at least 10 percent 
Project yield must exceed Boliden’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) adjusted for a risk premium (nominal 
WACC before tax is set at 12 percent, equivalent to 10 percent in real terms)  Major, long-term projects are usually 
calculated in real terms  The calculations are based on forecasts of interest rates, metal prices, exchange rates, 
inflation and other relevant assumptions based on internal analysis and external evaluations

The supply of metals necessary for societal development 
Boliden operates on the metal market’s two submarkets where raw 
materials are sold from mines to smelters, and where metals are 
sold mainly to industrial customers  Boliden’s integrated business 
model entails certain synergies and provides stable income for 
the Group, as mines and smelters often have different cycles for 
Impurities	 Deduction for impurities in the metal concentrates +	
Refining charges, the remuneration the smelter receives for the refining phase
Payable	 The payable metal content of the concentrates
Boliden’s Business Area Mines produces metal concentrates
Revenues are affected by ore tonnage, metal grades, 
recovery during the concentration process, inventory 
changes, the price of concentrates in USD, and exchange 
Gross profit and revenues usually have the same value, as 
Mines has no input raw materials  Revenues from metal 
concentrates are based on the London Metal Exchange 
(LME) price for each respective metal less treatment and 
refining charges (TC and RC) and impurities in concentrates, 
and calculated on the payable metal content (the propor-
tion of metal in concentrate for which the mines can charge)  
The levels of TC/ RC and impurity charges are determined 
in annual negotiations between leading mines and smelters 
and become the benchmark for other players  The levels are 
governed by the global supply of concentrates from mines 
Operating profit is gross profit less operating costs, mainly 
personnel, consumables, spare parts, external services, 
An individual mine has natural variations in grades, waste 
rock dilution, energy requirements at different depths, 
equipment maintenance and other factors that result in the 
profit varying over time  These variations are often known 
in advance and are clearly defined in life-of-mine plans  
Boliden guides on major changes in grades in the larger 
mines when grades are expected to significantly deviate 
Revenue from metals is based on the LME price of the 
metal with the addition of premiums, the level of which is 
determined by the local balance between metal demand, 
smelting capacity and payment terms  The premium also 
covers costs for transportation and customized alloys  
Gross profit is the difference between revenues and 
the price of the raw materials, and consists of treatment 
and refining charges (from concentrates and secondary 
raw materials), penalties (remuneration for impurities), 
metal premiums, income from free metals, and income 
from the sale of by-products  Free metals arise when the 
amount of metal recovered exceeds the payable metal 
content of purchased metal concentrates and secondary 
materials, while by-products such as sulphuric acid are 
extracted in the processes  The content of payable metal 
Operating profit is gross profit less operating costs, the 
most important of which are personnel, consumables, 
spare parts, external services, energy and depreciation  
Unlike Mines, Smelters has a similar production situation 
over time with the exception of annual maintenance 
warm season  The scope varies from year to year, as 
more extensive maintenance is usually carried out every 
two years  Boliden provides guidance on the date and 
financial impact of maintenance shutdowns for the year 
Because Boliden’s smelters have the capacity to handle twice as much volume as 
its mines produce, significant volumes of concentrate are purchased from external 
mines  The sale of all metal concentrates between Boliden’s mines and smelters 
takes place according to market terms  Bars in the charts are not to scale 
the smelter receives for refining the smelting material

Starting from our Annual- and sustainability report for FY2024, 
Boliden will report on sustainability according to the new Corporate 
Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) from the EU, as transposed 
into Swedish legislation  The reporting will cover environmental, 
social and governance aspects related to Boliden’s operations and 
value chain, based on the requirements in the European Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ESRS)  The aim of CSRD and ESRS is to provide 
reliable and comparable sustainability data to impacted stakeholders 
and users of sustainability information  In the coming years, sec-
Boliden is currently implementing the new reporting standards across 
the organization  The work is led by topical experts within the different 
areas and coordinated by the Climate & Sustainability Control function 
at Group  A first double materiality assessment was conducted 
during 2023, which sets the scope for our ESRS reporting  Short-term, 
Boliden is focusing on ensuring compliance with the new reporting 
requirements  Long-term, the more comprehensive and comparable 
sustainability reporting can support Boliden’s aim to become the most 
We strive for a work culture based on employee participa-
tion and involvement with responsibility and decision-mak-
ing as close to the areas concerned as possible  We want to 
ensure that our 10 general managers, and all line managers, 
feel fully responsible and fully empowered to run their busi-
nesses  Financial planning is conservative to manage market 
volatility and the strength of the balance sheet is adjusted 
to be prepared for both weak markets and opportunities 
for acquisitions and investments, while financial targets and 
dividend policy are set to reflect the desired risk level 
Boliden’s focus on responsible and sustainable operations of 
high international standard has been the foundation for the 
company for a long time  Competences have been devel-
oped to be competitive in the transformation of the industry 
as it meets more stringent demands on sustainability and 
reduced environmental footprint and climate impact  Today, 
Boliden can be considered the industry benchmark due to 
our world-class productivity and a climate impact that is 
CO2 emissions is a strategic area where Boliden has the 
ambitious target of reducing absolute carbon dioxide 
emissions by 42 percent by 2030, with 2021 as the base year  
The roadmap to meet the 2030 targets has been incorpo-
rated into the long-term financial plan, fully accounting for 
the required investments and other commercial deci-
sions  Moreover, Boliden has committed to science-based 
targets, which creates value by improving our risk profile, 
strengthening the possibility for social and legal license to 
operate, improving access to different sources of capital 
and strengthening the ability to attract and retain talent in 
A safe and healthy workplace is a fundamental prerequisite 
for running a successful company characterized by care for 
people, high productivity, and profitability  Development 
of a strong safety culture has been ongoing for many years 
in Boliden and statistically, our employees are now safer 
at work than in their spare time  By focusing on proactive 
measures, exchange of experience and learning from others 
as well as greater involvement on the part of management, 
employees, and contractors in day-to-day safety work, we 
have been successful in reducing the number of accidents 
Boliden has a history of profitable mining with low grade 
ores and has developed technical skills in mines and 
smelters that generate good profitability despite a high 
cost structure in the operating countries  The strategy is 
centred around continuous improvements and a focus on 
operational efficiency, which contribute to value generation 
without the need for major investments  Strong and com-
petitive operating units form the basis for organic growth  
Expansion of existing operations is normally less capital 
intensive and associated with less risk than new projects or 
acquisitions  To supplement organic growth, we evaluate 
different opportunities for acquisitions and collaborations 
for exploration according to strict investment criteria  
Base metals are needed for Europe’s transition towards climate-friendly 
societies  Demand is not only driven by increasing prosperity and 
urbanization, but also by electrification, energy storage and for more 
stringent product lifespan and recyclability requirements  As a provider 
of these metals, Boliden’s sustainable production processes within mining 
and smelting are essential to remain competitive, and our strategy aims to 
secure a strong position in the markets of today and tomorrow 
To provide the metals essential to improve society for generations to come 
To be the most climate friendly and respected metal provider in the world  
Our value chain begins in exploration and through our mines, 
concentrators and smelters, we create the metals that enable 
the climate transition  To a large extent, our success depends on 
the surroundings of our operations, with local stakeholders such 
as indigenous people and neighboring communities, as well as 
We need mineral deposits in order to run our mining opera-
tions  Exploration is about finding, prioritizing, investigating 
and analyzing these in order to examine the conditions for 
potential mining operations  Aerial surveying, outcrop-
pings, geophysical and seismic methods are used initially, 
while diamond core drilling is the final stage of the process  
It can take 5–20 years from the initial explorations to the 
start of mining, but by primarily exploring in the vicinity of 
our mines, we can shorten lead times  At the same time, 
we invest in field exploration in entirely new areas and also 
acquire projects from other companies  All in all, this creates 
a long-term perspective in our exploration work, which 
helps safeguard metal supply for a long time to come 
Boliden extracts metals both in tunnel systems as deep 
as 1,600 meters below the surface and in open pit mines 
with surface areas greater than 50 football pitches  Using 
innovative processes such as automation and geoposition-
ing, we can boast world-class productivity  Solutions such as 
energy conserving heat exchangers in underground mines, 
an ambitious electrification strategy, good access to water 
and fossil fuel-free electricity enable us to extract ore with 
comparatively low climate and environmental impact  And 
when the ore eventually runs out, we make sure the land we 
use is restored in the best way possible through continuous 
reclamation activities, currently covering about 30 active 
During the year, we conducted trials with electric 
The mills at our concentrators grind crushed ore into a 
porous state before it is passed on for flotation, where 
the desired metal is separated from unwanted tailings  
For example, zinc ore initially has a metal content of 3–7 
percent, but after the final stage of the concentration 
process, dewatering and filtration, it has a 55 percent zinc 
content  The residue left over is deposited in a tailings pond 
with surrounding dam structures  We systematically use 
mineralogical studies to optimize concentration and have 
a dedicated pilot facility where we evaluate methods and 
The last part of our internal value chain consists of our 
smelters  Using raw materials, of which roughly a third comes 
from Boliden’s mines, our smelters create finished products 
such as zinc with a metal content of 99 995 percent  Our 
smelters also recycle metals from secondary materials such 
as electronic scrap and used car batteries  The development 
of technology and skills, together with significant invest-
ments, allow us to continuously improve the environmental 
performance of our smelters, while the number of metal 
products and by-products, such as sulphuric acid, have 
increased over time  Diversification helps Boliden reduce 
cyclical sensitivity, and we store the waste from a number 
of smelters in underground repositories with the ambition 
of finding technologies in the future to help us extract even

as well as the ongoing SEK 5 billion project – one of 
Boliden’s biggest-ever investments – to reshape Aitik’s 
tailings facilities  −On track to becoming the world’s first fossil fuel-free 
mine, production at the Rävliden deposit in the Boliden Area 
started and the operation will be fully electric during the 
first half of 2025  −The start-up of production at Aitik’s Liikavaara deposit 
drew closer with the relocation of the E10 public road and 
the building of a road between the new open pit and the 
crusher  −A pilot for our Autonomous Hauling System – the first of its 
kind in Europe – was conducted in Aitik with seven trucks  
When implemented in 2024, 17 self-driving trucks will form 
part of our regular operations, with optimized driving 
performance and less idleness contributing to higher 
production capacity  −Due to a combination of a declining zinc price, high 
energy prices, operational challenges and general cost 
inflation, the Tara mine was placed under care and main-
tenance in July  Most of the workforce are on temporary 
furlough until the mine reopens  Planning for a restart 
during 2024 is ongoing, exploring how to create a more 
cost-efficient operation model with higher productivity  −Production challenges during the year affected Aitik, 
throughput and lower production of metal in concentrate 
Business Area Smelters −All our smelters improved safety performance, which 
partly is considered a result of several acitivities aimed at 
strengthening our culture and employee engagement  −The major investment made into Harjavalta’s nickel line 
during the preceeding year started to pay off with pro-
duction successfully ramping up to design capacity  −In Harjavalta’s harbor, the Poseidon project – a state-of-
the art facility for fully automatic sampling of inbound 
raw materials – was delivered, shortening the lead time 
and increasing the capacity and accuracy of determining 
the value of purchased concentrates  −At Odda, the creation of the world’s most advanced zinc 
smelter reached peak intensity towards the end of the 
year with more than 1,000 employees and contractors 
working on the project  −A long-term process improvement program in Kokkola 
has improved productivity in operations  Kokkola also 
showed exceptional capability to adapt to volatility in

In the production of our Green Transition Metals, we con-
stantly challenge ourselves to find new ways of reducing our 
emissions, which in turn supports our customers’ efforts to 
reduce total emissions for the products containing our metals  
By sharing our know-how in this respect, we contribute to the 
green transition in the entire mining and metals industry 
Green Transition Metals is our portfolio of low-carbon 
and recycled products  It contains some of the most 
sustainable offerings on the global market – helping 
Boliden provides Tata Steel, one of the world’s major 
steel producers, with Low-Carbon Zinc, to be used in, for

Steel strengthen our role as a driver of sustainability 
“The agreement with Tata Steel Nederland is further proof 
of our ambition to spearhead the industry  The partnership 
focuses on the provision of zinc with the lowest carbon 
footprint globally, reducing the CO2 emissions in Tata Steel’s 
production, which in turn creates a more sustainable steel 
offering, which is demanded especially by the automotive 
sector  We support our customers’ sustainability targets by 
helping them reduce scope 3 emissions and thus contribute 
to improving climate performance in their respective indus-
“Choosing Boliden’s Low-Carbon Zinc leads to a signifi-
cantly reduced carbon footprint  With emissions of 1 tonne 
CO2 per tonne zinc, compared to the average zinc product 
globally with emissions of 3 6 tonnes, the reduction equals 
the annual car usage of more than 25,000 households  The 
lower emissions level of our zinc contributes to our common 
commitment to environmental accountability and lower CO2 
emissions across the entire value chain  This not only reflects 
the strive for sustainability but also a strategic move to push 
the entire industry towards more climate-friendly produc-
“While we will continue our efforts to produce zinc with 
minimal environmental impact, we are already today 
leading the industry in this respect  Demand is increasing 
and we see that our customers actively pursue alternatives 
with limited emissions levels, often as a response to scope

through the added capacity generated by the ongoing 
expansion of Odda smelter and the continuous innovation 
taking place at Kokkola – will be part of providing more 
Occupational health and safety is our most important focus 
area as it involves the well-being and, ultimately, the lives 
of our employees and contractors  We have a zero-harm 
philosophy with regard to accidents and harm at work  A 
strong safety culture is characterized by a values-driven 
leadership that trusts employees’ ability to act in relation to 
risk, health, safety and well-being  We promote initiatives 
designed to engage employees on a more informal basis 
by encouraging them to submit suggestions for health and 
safety improvements  Risk assessment is a requirement of 
ISO 45001:2018, which all Boliden units are certified to, and 
involves internal and external audits on their risk assessment 
processes and performance  In 2023, employees and con-
The frequency of accidents with absence (LTI) has decreased 
since last year  The number of accidents resulting in absence 
from work, including contractors, was 77 (75)  The number 
of work days of absence due to accidents among Boliden 
accidents included slip, trip and falls, and finger/hand inju-
ries while working with hand tools  The number of serious 
accidents has also decreased in recent years as a result of 
proactive safety work  Work-related fatalities are very rare 
within Boliden  No work-related fatalities have occurred 
on sites or areas controlled by Boliden since 2008, which is 
an exceptional result in the potential high-risk industry the 
In 2023, 4,923 employees (84 percent of workforce) partic-
ipated in the annual employee survey “My Opinion”, which 
covers health, safety and well-being topics  The results were 
discussed in local working groups and a joint action plan 
with local measures will be implemented during 2024 to 
drive safety performance at all units  Additional support is 
provided to units with the greatest improvement potential 
Strengthening the values-driven corporate culture increases 
Boliden’s performance in all areas and the value creation 
for all stakeholders, and is also a prerequisite for Boliden 
to continue to be a leader within sustainability  The work 
to further establish the values, principles and related focus 
areas in the organization continued during 2023 through 
In 2023, Boliden’s annual General Management Meeting for 
our most senior managers explored how to further engage 
people, with the aim of unleashing the potential of our indi-
viduals, teams, and organizations  The key to engagement, 
performance and safety lies in a fearless organization char-
acterized by strong psychological safety, and the meeting 
participants were tasked with strengthening the focus on 
this in their respective teams  Diversity, equality and inclusion
Boliden needs a diversity of experiences, perspectives, 
and ideas to ensure strong business results and to build 
innovative and successful teams  Diversity perspectives are 
considered in selection and group composition in Boliden’s 
development programs as well as in recruitment processes  Boliden has the target to increase the share of women in its 
total workforce  In 2023, 30 percent of all new permanent 
employees were women  We also launched a new devel-
opment program, Female Professionals in Boliden, open to 
all employees who identify as female  The program aimed 
at strengthening the work in the field of gender equality 
and brings together women within the company to meet, 
1) The number of proactive reports (risks, disorders) per reactive deviations (Loss Time Injury, Injury 
2) The number of accidents with absence per million hours worked, including both Boliden employees 
exchange experiences, collaborate and network  In May 
2023, Boliden also launched the research-based digital 
lecture “Diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) - Unlock 
Business Potential”, available to all employees  The purpose 
of the activity was to further strengthen our DEI work, 
provide knowledge about diversity, equality, and inclusion, 
Attracting and retaining relevant competence is an 
important part of Boliden’s strategy and requires long-term 
planning and persistent work  The competition on the labor 
market is still increasing in many of the places where we 
operate, as a result of the industrial sector growth in those 
Many activities were conducted locally during the year, 
where Boliden interacts with selected schools and uni-
versities  In addition to meeting students, other import-

What evoked your interest in the mining and metals 
“I chose to pursue my studies in metallurgical engineering 
at the bachelor level because the discipline covers a huge 
role in the supply chain of materials that is used in modern 
society and this makes the field worth practicing  Already 
there I realized there were great possibilities in optimizing 
minerals and metals extraction  Small improvements could 
have a huge impact on operations and contribute to the 
goal of improving sustainability in the mining and smelting 
industries  From there, I decided to do an International 
Master’s program in Sustainable and Innovative Natural 
Resource Management, during which I encountered many 
companies focused on raw materials processing  Boliden 
stood out in its ambitious sustainability targets and had a 
strong track record of taking action to achieve its targets  I wanted to become a part of that ”

Why should people apply to Boliden’s trainee program? 
“We are a very diverse group of trainees which ignites 
dynamic discussions and interesting exchanges of ideas – 
learning becomes more fun together in this group  While 
we all have individual roles at different business sites around 
Sweden and Finland, we do meet up regularly as part of

and the product side of this work as well as technology and 
development, and this job really checks both boxes  My job 
is very flexible, and I am involved in everything from solving 
daily quality problems to investing in projects and research ” What is most challenging about your work? “Since my work includes generating ideas and perspectives 
on new research and development, it is necessary to have a 
network for collaboration, which can take time to build  In 
many cases, expert knowledge is required in a certain area 
and, when working with development, it helps a lot to get 
relevant advice and support on the issue  There are routines 
for this and contexts for exchanging experiences, which 
is very valuable in my job  At the same time, the personal 
network is important to be able to find experience of similar 
situations that can be applied to my specific challenges ” You joined Boliden less than a year ago, what was your 
first impression when you joined? “I got to know Boliden a bit already before I joined, thanks 
to a lecture at the university where I studied  I immediately 
realized that it is quite a large company with many separate 
plants that are run in completely different ways  When you 
include the mines as well, it becomes very complex  My first 
impression was that, despite the complexity, there was a lot 
of collaboration going on within the organization  During 
my first few months here at Boliden Rönnskär I have had the 
privilege of meeting many colleagues from different parts 
Contractor at Boliden Aitik’s major investment project 
aimed to ensure dam facility compliance with the Global 
“This very large project started during the summer of 2022, 
and given its size, it had a very short time plan of only 
two years  As the planning proceeded, it became clear 
that Boliden was short on internal resources to handle all 
aspects of the project coordination and thus approached 
my employer Licab for support  Having worked at Boliden 
2012–2015 as a truck driver I knew the company well and 
saw a great opportunity in taking on this slightly chaotic 
project start and getting things in order and since February 
2023, as a consultant for Boliden, I have been coordinating 
the work of subcontractors in the many different disciplines 
we have in this massive project  To be able to reinforce the 
dam structures, a wide range of sub-projects needs to be 
carried out, such as building new pump stations, building 
new truck haul roads and large electricity and automations 
projects since the dam reinforcements impact the infra-
How is Boliden’s focus on health and safety reflected for 
“Boliden Aitik is very well known here in Gällivare for its 
safety culture and zero-target for injuries and this is also 
reflected in my experience as a consultant  The first week we 
had an extensive training in Health, Environment and Safety 
and this is a recurring topic in all our project meetings, as is 
the reporting system for any deviations from normal safety 
routines  In my role I am also responsible for ensuring that 
all coordination meetings with subcontractors also follow 
this pattern  Furthermore, we have one full-time Health, 
Metallurgy Operations Generalist, Purification Supervisory, 
Boliden Harjavalta What made you apply for a job at Boliden 21 years ago? 
“Just like it is today, Boliden was a large employer at the time 
and I had heard only good things about the company  This 
made me apply for an apprenticeship and after that I got 
a permanent job  Now I work as an operator in the liquid 
purification plant, taking samples, loading the acid trucks 
“There is a lot of variation in my daily work  I also think it’s 
important that the industry operates safely and respon-
sibly  Besides my job as an operator, I am also the deputy 
occupational health and safety representative and the 
department’s deputy union steward  As occupational health 
and safety representative, I need to ensure that everyone 
returns home safe and healthy after a day at work ” 
Why do you think someone should consider working in 
“There are a great many interesting jobs in the field and I 
highly recommend working in it  Working at Boliden you will 
soon notice that we operate responsibly and with respect 
Environment and Safety consultant working on the project 
every day of the week, ensuring that there is always a 
person on site with overhead responsibility to handle any 
issues related to these particularly important topics ”
What are the pros and cons of being a consultant compared to being an employee? 
“As I have experience of being employed and am now 
working as a consultant here and know a lot of people 
working in different parts of Aitik, I can say that Boliden is 
generally a great company to work for  On the plus side, 
as a contractor I have easy access to further resources and 
competencies from my employer Licab if I need help on 
specific topics  On the other hand, as a consultant I lack 
the instant access to all the internal systems you have as an 
employee, and there are always areas both big and small 
where consultants naturally don’t have the mandate to 
take decisions  Being a Gällivare local with a large personal 
network of people employed at Aitik has helped me a lot in 
We have also reassessed the accounting methodology for cal-
culating our scope 1 emissions, leading to a restatement of our 
2021 and 2022 emissions  For example, we are now account-
ing for carbon dioxide equivalents, which is a standardized 
and comprehensive metric that includes emissions from all 
greenhouse gases  Accordingly, the green house gases are 
weighted by their global warming potential to show their 
warming impact using CO2 as a reference  In addition, we are 
now disclosing our actual full year data (instead of estimated 
December data as previously used), as well as including land 
During 2023, our scope 1 and 2 emissions fell by 8 percent 
compared to the previous year  The decrease was reinforced 
by Tara being put into care and maintenance and to some 
extent also by the production interruption caused by the fire 
in Rönnskär  However, the Rönnskär fire also had a negative 
impact on our production of Low-Carbon Copper while pro-
duction of Low-Carbon Zinc was affected by a prolonged 
Our roadmap for emissions reduction is progressing as 
planned and contributing activities during the year were, for 
example, replacing carbon-intensive cement with waste slag 
in Garpenberg, further electrification and full-scale use of 
nitrate free low-emission explosives in the Boliden Area and 
increasing the share of rail transportation between Kevitsa 
Boliden is committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 
2 green house gas emissions, measured in carbon dioxide 
equivalents (CO2e), by 42 percent from base year 2021 until 
2030 (the target boundary includes biogenic land-related 
emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstock)  We also 
commit to reducing absolute scope 3 CO2e emissions by 
30 percent within the same time frame, as well as achieving 
copper and zinc production with CO2e emissions per kilo-
gram metal averaging 1 5 and 1 0 kilograms, respectively  
In December 2023, our scope 1 and 2 targets were validated 
and approved by The Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious 
emissions reductions targets in line with the latest climate 
science  The SBTi is a collaboration between CDP, the United 
Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) 
and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and one of the 
We Mean Business Coalition commitments  It defines and 
promotes best practice in science-based target setting, 
offers resources and guidance to reduce barriers to adop-
tion, and independently assesses and approves companies’ 
targets  Boliden has also committed its scope 3 target to 
We have established the baseline for our scope 3 emissions 
amounting to CO2e 2,814 ktonnes  Throughout the year, 
efforts have been prioritized to enhance the precision in 
accounting for our scope 3 emissions  We have developed an 
emissions accounting methodology based on in-house data, 
including actual spending, material usage, and information 
from direct suppliers , and third-party emission factors when 
actual emissions are not available from supplier  From 2024, 
we will report annually on scope 3 progress  Read more about 
that our ambition is in line with the 1 5°C target

Within Business Area Mines there are several ongoing 
projects to increase the degree of electrification  The main 
objective of these projects is to increase productivity while 
reducing the amount of fossil fuel in the operation  Another 
important objective is to improve the work environment at 
the mines  Today, the main electricity consumption within 
the mines is related to the mills and crushers as well as 
conveyour belts  As the development progresses, transport 
vehicles, drill rigs and such will increase their share of elec-
Expansion of zinc production with fossil fuel-free energy
In Business Area Smelters, most electricity consumption is 
related to our zinc smelting in Kokkola and Odda  The latter 
has also secured a long term and fossil fuel-free energy 
contract which covers the increased energy consumption 
due to expanded operations during 2024  Rönnskär and 
Harjavalta are, however, also large energy consumers  Thus, 
the fire in Rönnskär meant that the energy consumption 
was somewhat reduced during the second half of the year  
Also within our smelting operations several projects related 
to electrification, including electrified vehicles, are being 
Our operations are largely located in areas with a good 
supply of fossil fuel-free energy and, to secure long-term 
low Scope 2 emissions, Boliden is actively working to 
improve conditions for fossil fuel-free energy production 
in national grids  The short-term aim is to have around 80 
percent of our electricity consumption secured through 
fixed contracts  Today, around 60 percent of our electricity 
consumption is hedged up to 2035 at competitve price 
levels and we are constantly monitoring the energy market 
for opportunities with the aim to balance the risk while 
supporting development programs at our units  During the 
year, Boliden also had revenues from the sale of electricity, 
partly because the operation optimizes production when 
the price of electricity peaks, and partly because of less 
than full production for other reasons such as unplanned

Before signing contracts with suppliers, we perform 
sanctions controls and check that the supplier complies 
with Boliden’s black lists, Boliden Business Partner Code of 
Conduct and Boliden’s requirements regarding quality and 
We strive to make sure that suppliers maintain a high level 
of compliance and fully understand Boliden’s strategy, and

Our operations have, by their nature, a signficant 
achieving our vision to be the most climate-friendly 
We have an impact on the local environment due to emis-
sions, acidification, contribtion to eutrophication, noise and 
changes in the landscape  We also have a global footprint due 
to carbon dioxide emissions  Because our metals are needed 
for the climate transition, we also have a far-reaching respon-
sibility to limit our environmental impact and we constantly 
measure our performance in this respect  Our ultimate ambi-
tion is to ensure zero harm to people and the environment 
We cannot define what our impact on people and the envi-
ronment is on our own, therefore it is essential that we have 
a close dialogue with the people that are impacted by our 
operations and that have a stake in what we do  We initiate 
partnerships and relationships with for example indigenous 
peoples, environmental organizations and local communi-
ties to ensure our environmental impact is managed in the 
All our operations are located in areas deemed as low water 
stress areas  Our challenges related to water, in particular 
at our mines, lie whithin the management of water that is 
released during operations  All operations, at both mines 
and smelters, measure the impact on water bodies in 
comprehensive water management programs to ensure we 
minimize any risk to life in water and on land  During 2023, 
the discharges of metals to water increased  The underlying 
reasons for this were challenges with the water treatment 
systems at our Odda and Rönnskär smelters  This is being 
addressed by, for example, the construction of a new water 
Our most important target for waste regards safe waste 
management, which we have formalized in the target 
to implement Global Industry Standard for Tailings 
Management (GISTM) at all our tailings facilities, located 
at both active and closed operations, by 2025  We are 
also committed to minimizing the current waste streams 
at our operations  We are driving projects that aim to 
produce products from current residue and recover more 
valuable metals, an area where we see vast opportunities  
For instance, we have developed a carbon dioxide free 
Supplementary Cementitious Material – a product possible 
to produce from all iron containing residues that come as 
a waste stream from the metal production at our smelters  
For other hazardous waste streams containing elements 
such as mercury, arsenic or cadmium, we store the waste 
in safe repositories underground or in mountain caverns, 
while performing research and development targeted at 
finding use cases for it  These solutions help to eliminate the 
hazardous elements from being used in society and protect

To compensate for our impact we have set the target to 
contribute positively to biodiversity by 2030 in all regions 
where we operate  Our operations shall be sustainable 
throughout the entire value chain – from prospecting and 
production, through closure planning and closure in the 
long-term  One core principle for achieving increased 
biodiversity is to operate in accordance with a mitigation 
hierarchy: avoid any impact if possible, minimize impact that 
cannot be avoided, restore impacts through rehabilitation 
and ecological restoration and compensate for any residual 
Biodiversity Management Plans have been developed for 
our Kevitsa and Garpenberg sites, and plans for the remain-
ing business units are in progress  The plans reinforce how 
we work with biodiversity and ultimately strive toward cre-
ating a net gain for biodiversity at our sites in collaboration 
with local communities and other key stakeholders  
Boliden assesses biodiversity performance at our operating 
sites and demonstrates responsible management by miti-
gating and reversing biodiversity impacts while sustaining 
A selection of compensation activities during 2023 −At Kylylahti the work with the extensive plan for ecologi-
cal rehabilitation at the closed mine site was completed  
This involved the creation of wildflower meadows and 
wetlands, and biodiversity enhancements in existing 
woodlands with the creation of dead wood habitats and 
controlled burning  −Rehabilitation of the closed mine site in Långdal continued 
with an extensive program for ecological rehabilitation, 
both on land and in water  The plan includes re-establish-
ment of different forms of ecosystem services and to bring 
people back to the site by developing a sustainability park  −Partnerships were established to harvest meadow 
cuttings from a local conservation area, as well as tree 
planting for each visiting artist at the Skellefteå concert 
hall to recreate a deciduous woodland  −Extensive ecological rehabilitation was initiated at the 
closed mine Rävlidmyren, where earth works are com-
pleted and habitats will be created in 2024  −At the zinc smelter in Kokkola the sea was stocked with 
around 52,000 whitefish and 26,000 trout to compensate 
for the impact of effluents on fish stocks  In addition, in 
co-operation with local fishermen and fishing commu-
nities we aim to stock 3 5 million juvenile whitefish every

Potential incidents at our tailings storage facilities 
constitute one of the most severe environmental risks 
for Boliden and adhering to the highest international 
standards for dam safety is therefore necessary for our 
Safe and responsible management of tailings storage 
facilities is of high importance to Boliden  These consist of 
tailings and clarification ponds with dam structures and 
associated critical infrastructure such as those for handling 
and treating water and conveying tailings  Tailings from the 
concentrator are deposited in the tailings pond, along with 
process water created as a result of our operations  In order 
to reduce the amount of water stored in the tailings pond, 
excess water is led from the pond to the clarification pond  
This water is recycled as process water or is purified before 
Boliden has set up a tailings and dam safety manage-
ment system that administers the facilities for which we 
are responsible  We manage the risks continuously in a 
systematic way to ensure that the function and abilities of 
the structure meet international standards, meaning that 
risk levels are kept as low as virtually possible  Every tailings 
storage facility has its own dam safety organization to 
ensure compliance with laws, requirements, standards and 
obligations  Monitoring takes place in the form of regular 
inspections, sometimes drone assisted, and readings col-
lected from instrumentation by means of innovative solu-
tions are evaluated against set limits  In the event of a devi-
ation from a limit value, there are established emergency 
procedures and action plans  Boliden also uses independent 
auditors at regular intervals to continuously improve and 
ensure compliance with best international standards 
Development during 2023 −No significant incidents occurred at our tailings storage facilities  −Execution of Aitik’s SEK 5 billion dam safety project 
started in April 2023 and will run for two years  The dam safety measures consist of stabilization through exten-
sive foundation preparation and buttressing work to 
improve the stability of some of the dam embankments  
The project also includes relocation and reconstruction 
of impacted infrastructure such as pump stations and 
haulage roads  −Garpenberg was permitted to continue the initiated change to centerline dam construction  −Implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management continued  
An important part of Boliden’s work after mining has ceased 
is the reclamation of the land we used to ensure the land 
can be used again in the future  In addition to the succes-
sive reclamation measures carried out at active facilities, 
we manage around 30 closed sites  These historical sites 
are monitored systematically and reclamation activities are 
Conditions such as topography, water flows, groundwater 
levels, and the nature of waste determine the methods used 
in reclamation, and according to global guidelines, every 
active mine should draw up a site-specific mine closure plan  
To minimize our environmental impact in closed mining 
areas, we carry out collaborative projects with a large 
number of organizations, universities and companies, and 
also conduct research to develop new technologies with the 
aim to, for example, promote biodiversity  Depending on 
the wishes of the local community, reclamation can, in addi-
tion to the restoration of nature, also be directed toward 
creating added value in the form of recreational areas or 
Development during 2023 −We increased our provisions for reclamation by SEK 3 8 
billion  The reason for this was mainly to ensure effective 
reclamation after the closure of Aitik as its expected life of 
mine, subject to permit, has been extended by approxi-
mately 20 years  −The remediation project at the Åkerberg mine contin-
ued during 2023  Crushed waste rock was transported 
to Kankberg, to be used as backfill in the mine  Road 
material to all mines in the Boliden area has also been 
produced and delivered from Åkerberg  Electric crushing 
at the site started and will continue over the coming years  −The second year of the reclamation project in Rävlidmyr 
mine focused on covering the mine waste that was exca-
Extracted from a local burrow at the site, due to its natural 
clay content the till is suitable for creating a compacted 
low permeable layer on top of the mine waste to prohibit 
further oxidation and infiltration  The technical part 
of the remediations was completed and finalization of

Being subject to the Norwegian Transparency Act, Boliden 
is obliged to conduct due diligence on an ongoing basis  
During 2023, Boliden conducted several activities to 
strengthen its approach to human rights and human rights 
due diligence  Comprehensive training was offered to key 
personnel across the organization, a human rights working 
group was established, a human rights due diligence gap 
analysis was conducted and local human rights impact 
assessments were conducted on two of the mine sites  The 
human rights impact assessment reports showed a total of 7 
heightened human rights impacts, and 5 that were deemed 
salient  The salient impacts cover workplace health and 
safety (for example severe physical injuries and exposure to 
toxic materials), contractors and supply chain (for example 
discrimination and forced labor), indigenous peoples (Sámi, 
for example negative effects on their cultural heritage), 
tailings and water (for example dam breach or environmen-
tal impacts negatively affecting peoples’ life)  A roadmap 
for continued work with human rights and human rights 
due diligence is under development and will be finalized by 
the beginning of 2024  The roadmap will build on the gap 
Our Diversity Policy states that if a discrimination incident 
should occur, the affected employee shall initially raise the 
matter with their manager and then with the company’s HR 
function, or through the whistleblower reporting system 
(accessible via the intranet and Boliden’s external website) 
During 2023, 3 incidents of discrimination were reported 
reviewed and remediation plans were implemented for all

and ensure these special rights, Boliden has together with 
ment within the Swedish Association of Mines, Mineral and 
Metal Producers (Svemin)  Boliden has also implemented 
a commitment regarding indigenous peoples in line with 
the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 
In relation to the commitments above, Boliden seeks to 
engage with potentially impacted indigenous peoples to 
ensure that the development of mining and metals projects 
fosters respect for the rights, interests, aspirations, culture 
and natural resource-based livelihoods of indigenous 
peoples  When applicable, we also seek to design projects 
to avoid adverse impacts and to minimize, manage or 
compensate unavoidable impacts in line with the mitigation 
hiearchy  Lastly, we also seek to ensure sustainable benefits 
and opportunities for indigenous peoples when developing 
mining and metals projects  Many of Boliden’s operations 
have been in production for several decades, and dialogues 
as well as collaborations have been developed accordingly  
Apart from exploration activities, the mining units affected 
by the special rights of indigenous peoples are Aitik, the 
Boliden Area, Garpenberg and Kevitsa  In recent years, 
much emphasis has also been put on ensuring these rights 
and the mitigation hierarchy in the development projects 
Liikavara and Nautanen around Aitik as well as the expan-
In order to find ways for the mining industry and indigenous 
peoples to co-exist in the long run, Boliden pursues knowl-
edge development and continual dialogues to provide the 
right framework and conditions for such co-existence  The 
possibility to remediate former mining areas so they may 
once more serve as, for example, functional reindeer hus-
bandry areas is also a crucial matter within this context  
Within Business Area Smelters, Boliden purchases concen-
trates from other mining companies  To ensure that the 
special rights of indigenous peoples are not endangered 
in our supply chain we conduct a due diligence process, 
where risks and activities are outlined, before any contracts 
are signed  When applicable, we also follow up the results 
through on site audits to ensure that indigenous peoples 
Cash flow from operating activities before changes in 
working capital was SEK 11,461 m (19,148)  Including a change 
in working capital, the total was SEK 12,183 m (16,398)  The 
transformation of Rönnskär’s business model, from selling 
copper cathodes to selling copper anodes, increased the 
running working capital level by about SEK 1 billion  However, 
this was partly compensated by less tied-up working capital 
as a result of lower metal prices  The decrease in working 
capital tied-up contributed positively to cash flow in the 
amount of SEK 722 m (-2,750)  Free cash flow totaled SEK 
-3,354 m (6,329) and tax paid for the year was SEK 1,763 m 
On December 31, 2023, Boliden’s net debt was SEK 10,728 m 
(-15), which corresponds to a net debt/equity ratio of 19 percent (0)  Equity was SEK 56,420 m (58,325), including 
the mark-to-market of currency and interest rate derivatives 
in the amount of SEK 290 m (262) net after tax effect  The 
average term of Boliden’s total approved loan facilities at 
year-end was 3 3 years (3 4)  As of December 31, 2023 the 
average interest rate in the debt portfolio was 4 3 percent 
(2 5), and the fixed interest term was 1 1 years (1 7)  At year-
end, Boliden’s current liquidity, in the form of cash and cash 
equivalents and unutilized committed credit facilities with a 
term of more than one year, totaled SEK 14,843 m (23,005)

Boliden’s sales revenues in 2023 totaled SEK 78,554 m 
(86,437) and operating income totaled SEK 8,287 m (15,895)  
Lower volumes primarily due to lower grades in mines, the 
fire in Rönnskär and cost inflation caused the deteriora-
tion in earnings  In addition, prices and terms contributed 
negatively  Excluding process inventory revaluation, the 
consolidated operating profit was SEK 7,810 m (15,672)  The 
operating profit for Business Area Mines was SEK 3,111 m 
(9,318), and the operating profit for Business Area Smelters 
excluding revaluation of process inventory was SEK 4,485 m 
(5,916)  The absence of a tank house had a major negative 
impact on Rönnskär’s profitability  This was due to lower 
metal premiums and refining charges, as well as a decreased 
volume of free metals  Scheduled maintenance shutdowns 
for Smelters burdened profits with SEK -670 m (-500) in the 
forms of lower production and higher costs  Consolidated 
operating costs before depreciation increased to SEK 21,551 
m (20,059), primarily due to inflation  Earnings for 2023 
included an item affecting comparability in the amount 
of SEK -53 m for early retirements in Tara, and SEK -163 
m related to the Rönnskör fire  In addition, earnings were 
affected negatively by SEK 200 m linked to Rönnskär’s lost 
production and cancelled deliveries  Earnings for 2023 also 
included an insurance payment of 176 SEK m  This payment 
relates to the flooding in Tara in the fourth quarter of 2021  
Finally, earnings for 2023 included restructuring costs 
in Smelters amounting to SEK -55 m, consisting of early 
retirement costs in Rönnskär and asset write-downs in Odda  
Earnings for 2022 included an item affecting comparability in 
the amount of SEK -259 m attributable to an impairment of 
Boliden’s capital expenditure in 2023 totaled SEK 15,515 m 
(10,022)  In Mines, the capital expenditure in a new dam 
structure in Aitik was one of the year’s major projects, as was 
the expansion of the Rävliden deposit in the Boliden Area  
The largest investment in Smelters was the Odda expansion  
to lower grades in mines, the fire in Rönnskär and 
cost inflation caused the deterioration in earnings

Earnings per share were SEK 22 21 (45 37) The proposed ordinary dividend is SEK 7 50 (15 00), which is a ­
of exploration rights which was not the case in 2023  Aitik’s 
operating profit was significantly lower than in 2022  The 
decrease was due to a negative combination of lower 
metal prices, grades and milled volumes, along with higher 
costs  The Boliden Area’s operating profit was below the 
record profit of 2022, primarily due to lower metal prices  
Garpenberg’s operating profit decreased, year on year, due 
to less favorable market terms but also some disturbances 
in production  As such, Garpenberg failed to deliver record 
earnings for the third consecutive year  Kevitsa’s operating 
profit decreased substantially  Lower metal prices, lower 
grades and operational issues contributed negatively  Tara’s 
minor positive operating profit in 2022 turned into a large 
operating loss in 2023  In June 2023, it was resolved to place 
the Tara mine under care and maintenance  The mine was 
cash flow negative due to a combination of factors including 
a decline in the zinc price, high energy prices and treatment 
charges, general cost inflation and operational challenges 
The business area’s earnings for 2023 included an item 
The majority of Business Area Mines sales are to Business 
Area Smelters, and take place on market terms  Revenues 
decreased to SEK 18,683 m (24,755), of which external sales 
totaled SEK 1,331 m (1,611)  The operating profit for Mines 
decreased from last year’s record level to SEK 3,111 m (9,318) 
mainly due to a combination of lower metal prices, grades 
and milled volumes  Total operating costs for Mines before 
depreciations were SEK 11,444 m (11,119)  This corresponds 
to an increase of 3 percent (19) in local currency  External 
services contributed negatively while lower personnel 
expenses contributed positively  Capital expenditure totaled 
SEK 8,742 m (6,159)  Major projects included investments in 
a new dam construction and a new water treatment system 
in Aitik, the initial face of the Liikavaara project, also in Aitik, 
and the expansion of the Rävliden deposit in the Boliden 
Area  Depreciations decreased to SEK 4,488 m (4,661), 
mainly as a result of decreased production of metal in

The Business Area’s milled volume was lower in 2023 
compared to 2022  In addition, lower grades contributed 
negatively, which resulted in a lower production of metal 
in concentrate for all metals  However, production was 
positively affected by more normal rates of sick leave 
post Covid-19 pandemic, which increased the loading and 
haulage capacity in the open pits  Nevertheless, milled 
volumes in both Aitik and Kevitsa were below the record 
levels from 2022  Aitik only achieved its designed annual 
production rate of 45 Mtonnes of milled volume in the 
second quarter of 2023  Several production issues con-
tributed negatively  An unplanned maintenance stop and 
unusually unfavorable weather conditions lowered Aitik’s 
fourth quarter milled production by 2 Mtonnes  Because of 
an unplanned adjustment to the mining plan in Kevitsa, a 
larger proportion of mined production took place in areas 
with lower grades  Kevitsa’s nickel grade fell 11 percent year 
on year  Garpenberg’s milled volume reached a new annual 
record, despite some operational shortfalls  However, 
this was counteracted by lower grades leading to a lower 
production of zinc in concentrate compared to 2022  The 
Boliden Area’s production of metal in concentrates fell short 
of 2022 mainly due to lower grades  Tara’s milled volumes 
decreased by 47 percent relative to 2022 as the mine was 
placed under care and maintenance from July until the end 
of the year and its mill stopped on July 5  This contributed to 
a 25 percent decrease in Boliden’s total production of zinc in

6,773 m (3,862)  The largest investment in Smelters was the 
expansion in Odda  Depreciations increased to SEK 1,729 m 
(1,472), as a result of increased capital expenditure  
The fire that broke out in Rönnskär in June led to items 
affecting comparability totaling SEK –163 m  In addition, 
earnings in the second quarter were affected negatively 
by SEK 200 m linked to Rönnskär’s lost production and 
cancelled deliveries  The absence of a tank house had a 
major negative impact on Rönnskär’s profitability also for 
the remainder of the year  This was due to lower metal pre-
miums and refining charges, as well as a decreased volume 
of free metals  Harjavalta noted lower earnings compared to 
the 2022 all time high  Harjavalta’s earnings decrease should 
mainly be seen in the light of lower nickel prices  However, 
improved productivity in the nickel line contributed 
Revenues for Business Area Smelters totaled SEK 77,197 m 
(84,787), and gross profit excluding revaluation of process 
inventory was SEK 15,577 m (15,703)  Operating profit, 
excluding revaluation of process inventory, decreased from 
the 2022 business area record to SEK 4,485 m (5,916)  This 
was mainly as a result of lower volumes  Including a revalua-
tion of process inventory in the amount of SEK 477 m (223), 
operating profit totaled SEK 4,962 m (6,139)  Total operating 
costs for Smelters before depreciations were SEK 9,635 m 
(8,652)  This corresponds to an increase of 12 percent (19) 
in local currency  Costs increased largely driven by inflation 
and higher planned maintenance work  However, lower 
energy prices had a positive effect  Operating profit was 
affected in the amount of SEK –670 m (–500) by planned 
maintenance shutdowns  Capital expenditure totaled SEK

Operating costs, excluding depreciation, increased by 10 percent in local currencies compared to the previous year 
positively  Kokkola reported its highest operating earnings 
since 2006 and Odda set a new record  Both zinc smelters 
benefited from improved zinc treatment charges and higher 
metal premiums  Bergsöe’s earnings increased compared 
to 2022 thanks to improved process efficiency  Its operating 
earnings were the strongest since 2007  The operating profit

Group’s joint purchasing and sales companies, worsened 
in 2023 compared to 2022  This was due to deteriorating 
The production of nickel in matte in Harjavalta reached 
a new record  Less planned maintenance, higher nickel 
tion process contributed positively  However, Smelters’ 
production of gold did not reach the record from 2022  The 
fire in Rönnskär had a negative effect  The silver production 
fell sharply due to an equipment failure in Harjavalta  After 
the fire, Rönnskär, only produced anode copper, which led 
to a 55 percent year-on-year drop in its finished copper 
production  Zinc production decreased by 4 percent in 2023 
compared to 2022  Low availablity of zinc concentrates, in 
the third quarter, and process disturbances had a nega-
tive effect  In addition, due to commercial reasons, part of 
Odda’s production capacity was permanently closed on 
December 1st pending its new expansion  Lead production 
increased 7 percent relative to 2022  Production of lead 
alloys in Bergsöe reached a new record  The production of

right skills to join Boliden, for example by communicating 
Boliden’s purpose, values and its role as an enabler of the cli-
mate transition  It is equally important to retain and develop 
current employees by systematically supporting career 
opportunities, providing development programs as well as 
working with people engagement  This is carried out both at 
technological development during the year  We also 
further strengthened our collaborations within the 
industry, relevant universities, and other local stake-

Confidence in Boliden can be harmed by events such as 
serious incidents, or if employees or business partners 
fail to live up to business ethics and sustainability 
Because we seek to be associated with ethical, sustainable 
business partners, we conduct systematic evaluations of and 
monitor customers and suppliers, both potential and exis-

business partners on a number of parameters  They are 
expected to adopt Boliden’s Code of Conduct for Business

generally accepted business standards before agreements 
are concluded, and where necessary audits are carried out 
Political decisions may have effects on our operations  
Examples of such decisions include permit application 
Boliden and the trade associations in which we participate

Treatment charges are determined by the supply and 
demand for metal concentrates, which represents a risk 
since they constitute a large part of the smelters’ gross profit 
Treatment charges are negotiated annually by the major 
players in the mining and smelting industries  These terms 
are applied to our internal purchases, and in most contracts 
We are dependent on a few large customers for part of our 
product portfolio, and reduced demand from industrial 
customers would increase the risk of sales via the London

The risk is considered to have increased during the 
year as a result of the fire in Rönnskär and the adjust-

A stable, reliable raw materials supply is needed to enable 
the smelters to produce at high levels of capacity utilization 
and consistent quality  The implementation of barriers to international trade in metal concentrates is a related risk 
We manage risks with raw materials supply through long-

Supply chain risks have during the year mainly cente-

products and services at price and cost levels that 
make sense for the business  Chemicals have been the 
most troublesome area and lots of effort has been put 
into finding alternative sources to secure the most cost 
Because energy accounts for around 17 percent of operating costs, changes in energy prices constitute a significant risk 
In Norway, Odda has a long-term electricity agreement with

Pricing terms for products are based mainly on metal exchanges, and ours are priced largely in USD  As a result, transaction exposure arises from binding undertakings to 
our customers and suppliers, where the cost of raw materials

Transaction exposure in conjunction with binding underta-

make constant calculations concerning the way in which 
changes in metal and exchange rate markets affect Boliden’s 
financial position  For major investments the Group may 
enter into contracts to hedge forecasted sales from metal 
price and currencies  Future investment payments in curren-
cies other than the local currency may be hedged under cer-

be necessary for electricity generation, power distribution infrastructure 
and electrical equipment  Global demand for base metals is expected to 
Mines have limited lifespans and must be replaced by new ones, but 
this will only occur if mining companies believe future metal prices will 
yield profitable investments in new projects  The trend of increasingly 
comprehensive requirements from permit-issuing authorities and local 
communities, the larger scale of projects due to lower metal grades, and 
a growing need for infrastructure have gradually increased cost levels 
and capital intensity in the mining industry  Due to the above factors, 
developing a new mine usually takes many years, and the time from 
discovery to metal production is increasing  In current circumstances this 
could lead to future supply shortages for most of our main metals  While 
expansion in existing mines generally has lower capital intensity, it will 
only partially meet the future demand for metals  The smelting capacity 
expansion rate is based on the view companies have of demand in the 
regional market and the supply of raw materials  New capacity affects 
concentrate market balance and thus the terms between smelters and 
the mines  Metal recycling rates are expected to increase over time, but 
as with the expansion of existing mines, they are only able to meet part 
China accounts for about 40–50 percent of global base metal demand 
and significant shares of the world’s metal supply  Economic devel-
opment in the country is therefore of great importance for Boliden’s 
markets  China’s economy is expected to become more focused on 
services and less on infrastructure and real estate development, leading 
to lower future metal demand  At the same time, economic growth is 
expected to decline gradually  Smelting capacity expansion in China has 
developed at a fast pace in order to meet the rapid growth in demand 
for base metals  Metal imports are significant, and the Chinese smelting 
industry has become a major player in the global concentrate market, 
especially for copper  While China’s position as the world’s largest nickel 
producer was recently taken over by Indonesia, this was through major 
investments controlled by Chinese interests  Global copper and zinc 
mining capacity has sometimes been a limiting factor when investment 
growth was high in China  Even during periods of slowdown in global 
economic activity or when extraordinary situations have affected the 
economy, demand from China continued to be good, and therefore 
periods of low copper and zinc prices were brief from a historical 
The global economy showed resilience during 2023 amid a challenging 
macroeconomic backdrop with monetary tightening, volatile energy 
markets and increased geopolitical tensions  Global growth was stronger 
than anticipated and GDP increased by 2 6 percent  Inflation had already 
begun to fall in the beginning of the year as a response to the US Federal 
Reserve initiating interest rate hikes in 2022, followed by the European 
Central Bank and others  As central banks continued to increase interest 
rates, inflation kept falling in most of the major economies  Towards the 
end of the year, expectations of rate cuts in the near future had a positive 
effect on market sentiment, which also gave strong support to metal 
prices such as copper and gold  Geopolitical risks increased during the 
year as the war in Ukraine continued and the Israel-Hamas war broke 
out in October  Price spikes and supply disruptions closely linked to the 
war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia eased, including for 
energy, metals, and food items  Energy prices continued to be volatile, 
but to a lesser extent than in the previous year  The risks associated with 
the Covid-19 pandemic as a major global threat diminished  
The global stock market rebounded from the negative performance of 
2022  Especially the US stock market showed strong growth, partially 
driven by the hype surrounding artificial intelligence and the technology 
companies involved in its development  The growth in European stock 
indexes was more moderate and the discount to American companies 
were at historical highs  In the US, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, 
which offers tax credits and other incentives to promote investment, 
started to shape the renewable energy market in a significant way, with 
the US as the preferred destination, including investments in the supply 
chain of critical metals  The urgency to limit climate change increased 
and faster progress will be required to meet the 2030 target set by 
the Paris Agreement and net zero by 2050  At the UN Climate Change 
Conference (COP28), almost 200 countries pledged to move away from 
fossil fuels and triple new investments in renewable energy  
Price developments in the metals market were generally weak in 2023  
Both supply and demand for base metals increased and most markets 
were in surplus  With supply chains returning to more normal conditions 
and falling prices of raw materials, including metals, industrial destocking 
of inventories put further pressure on demand and prices 
Historically, increased metal demand has been strongly linked to global 
economic growth and especially to developments in China, which 
accounted for the single largest source of demand for base metals  
Although growth over the long term is expected to decline both globally 
and in China, metal demand will increase sharply thanks to climate 
transition and the electrification of societies  Ambitions to phase out 
Despite monetary tightening, volatile energy markets,

enced a strong increase in produced units, production 
remained below pre-Covid-19 levels  Consumers, still 
mindful of the previous year’s energy crisis, remained 
cautious  Zinc prices developed very poorly in 2023 
and fell by an average of 24 percent during the year 
despite significant supply adjustments in the mining 
operations completely, particularly in Europe  The zinc 
smelter industry, being energy-intensive, is vulnerable 
to high energy prices  As energy markets normalized 
in 2023, zinc production also stabilized, though some 
increased by 3 percent  LME inventories reached the 
highest level since 2021 and metal premiums fell  Spot 
market premiums were at historically high levels in 
the beginning of the year but nearly halved over the 
Demand for copper grew by 2 percent compared to the 
previous year, despite the macroeconomic headwinds  
offset by strong demand in China, where consumption 
increased by 6 percent  Copper continued to benefit 
from the trend toward increased electrification, battery 
charging and power transmission infrastructure, along 
with the supply-side issues  On average, the copper price 
fell by 4 percent during 2023, which was significantly less 
Global production of finished copper metal increased 
by 4 percent in 2023, primarily led by China where pro-

ums increased in Europe but fell in Asian markets  
The supply of concentrates increased by 5 percent in 
2023 but fell short of expectations as many mining 
Significant disruptions in key operations in Latin America 
contributed to this shortfall  Spot market treatment 
charges increased during most of 2023 but fell sharply 
during the year  Several mines became unprofitable 
due to weaker zinc prices and were put on care and 
maintenance  In the beginning of the year the concern 
was smelter availability, which resulted in improved 
charges in benchmark annual contracts set at USD 274 
(230) per tonne concentrate, including some positive 
towards the end of the year upon the news of reduced 
concentrate supply  Benchmark annual contracts at USD 
88/8 8 USc were above spot terms  Annual contracts for 
2024 were established at USD 80/8 0 USc  Production 
costs for mining companies continued to increase during 
the year from the higher base in 2022  Costs for power 
and fuel decreased but other items such as labor and 
consumables increased  Costs were also increased due 
to the effect of higher treatment charges and lower rev-
enues from by-products  Cash cost in the 90th percentile 
quickly shifted as mines began to suspend production 
and spot market treatment charges collapsed to levels 
significantly below the benchmark annual contracts  
As many mines struggled with profitability, efforts 
to rationalize production costs were carried out  The 
average cash cost level for the industry fell in 2023,

The Nomination Committee represents the shareholders  It is 
tasked with preparing and submitting proposals to the AGM 
concerning the number and election of members of the Board, 
the Chairman of the Board, fees payable to the Board and its 
committees, the election of auditors and fees payable to them 
and where necessary, the process and the criteria that govern 
participation in and the work of the Nomination Committee  
The focus of the Nomination Committee’s work is to ensure 
that the Board consists of members who jointly possess appro-
priate and relevant knowledge and experience for the benefit 
Accordingly, the Chairman of the Board presents the Nomi-
nation Committee with an evaluation of the work of the Board 
in its entirety and of the individual Board members during 
the past year as part of the process of selecting suitable 
Board members to be proposed for election by the AGM  The 
Nomination Committee usually also interviews and meets 
the Board members  Supported by the Audit Committee, the 
Nomination Committee also drafts proposals for the election 
of auditors  Shareholders may submit proposals to the Nomi-
nation Committee in accordance with the instructions available 
on the company’s website  The AGM passes resolutions on 
the principles governing the appointment and duties of the 
The 2023 AGM elected Lennart Francke (Swedbank Robur

as Chairman  The Chairman of the Board was seconded to the 
In accordance with the provisions of the Swedish Code of 
Corporate Governance, the Nomination Committee strives 
to ensure diversity and gender balance and has chosen to 
apply section 4 1 of the Code as its diversity policy  This means 
the Board shall, with regard to the company’s operations, 
development phase, future orientation and overall position, 
have a composition that is fit for purpose and whose members 
possess relevant multifaceted, broad and deep competencies, 
experiences and backgrounds  The requirement for the Board 
to have suitable, diversified skills and experience also calls 
for members proposed by the Nomination Committee to be 
evaluated on the basis of a number of different parameters  
The Nomination Committee has extensive experience of con-
ducting ambitious, qualified searches when selecting suitable 
candidates to allow a comprehensive combination of all the 
Boliden is a Swedish limited company listed on Nasdaq 
Boliden’s corporate governance is based on the Swedish

In addition to these, we use our internal control tool Boliden In-
ternal Control System (BICS) and a number of Group policies, in 
particular Boliden’s Code of Conduct, which all employees are 
required to be familiar with and adhere to  Also, our operations 
work in compliance with management systems for occupation-
al health & safety, environment, energy and quality  
Our largest shareholders are Swedish and foreign funds and 
institutions  At year-end 2023, the number of shareholders 
was 124,052 (113,050)  The largest individual shareholders were 
Swedbank Robur Fonder, Blackrock, Vanguard, T Rowe Price

Boliden’s shareholders exercise their rights by submitting 
proposals to, participating in and voting on the resolutions 
submitted to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) and any 
ordinary general meetings  Shareholders may request 
to add an item to the agenda of the AGM by sending a written 
request to the Board in due time before the issue of the notice 
for the AGM  Shareholders are also welcome to submit inquiries 
on company matters to the Board, the President and CEO, the 
The AGM is the highest corporate decision-making body  The 
resolutions of the AGM include election of members of the 
Board, Chairman of the Board and Nomination Committee, 
the adoption of the income statement and balance sheet, ap-
propriation of earnings and release from liability for members 
of the Board and the CEO, the approval of fees to members 
of the Board and auditors, and the approval of principles for 
remuneration of the CEO and other senior executives  Where 
applicable, the AGM also passes resolutions on changes to the 
articles of association and the election of auditors  AGMs are 
usually held at one of Boliden’s sites in Sweden combined with 
the possibility to participate through postal voting  In conjunc-
tion with the meetings, the shareholders have the opportunity 
to participate in guided tours in Boliden’s mines, concentrators 
or smelters to gain a deeper understanding of the operations 
and have an opportunity to meet Boliden’s employees  The 
Boliden has enjoyed a number of very successful and 
prosperous years, but 2023 entailed a shift with several 
challenges  How has this affected your role as Chairman 
“The metal and mining industry is volatile by its nature, and 
fluctuations in the base metal prices and currencies have a 
significant impact on us  In addition to global economic factors, 
Boliden has also had some internal events to tackle during 
2023, most importantly the fire at Rönnskär’s tank house, 
Tara being placed under care and maintenance and various 
operational issues related to production  These incidents have 
profoundly affected not only our business but also our people  
Fortunately, Boliden’s strong brand and firm financial position 
combined with our dedicated workforce and history of high 
performance provide a solid foundation for overcoming diffi-
culties that arise from time to time  Part of my role as Chairman 
is to focus on our strengths and provide motivation, support 
and guidance to the rest of the Board, the CEO and President 
and the management team in their continued work particu-
larly in challenging circumstances  This has necessitated more 
frequent board meetings, reassessment and affirmation of our 
strategic direction and continuous oversight to ensure we make 
appropriate decisions and progress in the right direction  
It is vital that we continue to be guided by our core values  We 
must care for our employees to ensure they feel supported 
during challenges, we should demonstrate the courage to take 
difficult decisions when needed, and we take responsibility 
to our stakeholders in continuing to be a reliable and strong 
business partner  Apart from support in navigating challenges, 
my role and the role of the Board of Directors is also to help 
positioning Boliden for the future by evaluating new opportu-
As always sustainability remains a key focus for the Board  
Boliden is one of the first mining and smelting companies 
that has been validated by SBTi  We are also preparing for the 
implementation of the new CSRD reporting standards across 
Europe  All in all, over the longer term, I am confident that 
Boliden is well-positioned to benefit from increasing demand 
for our metals, driven by the transition to a green economy and 
On the back of his second year as Chairman of the Board, 
Karl-Henrik Sundström, reflects on board work during more 
In 2023, 43 percent of the Board members elected by the AGM 
were women  The ambition is to maintain an even gender 
distribution as well as an appropriate Board composition fit for 
purpose and meeting the company’s requirements  The Nom-
ination Committee has not yet completed its work for the 2024 
AGM when this Annual and Sustainability Report is released 
for publication  The Nomination Committee’s proposals will be 
submitted in its motivated statement, which will be published 
in the notice of attendance to the AGM and on our company 
The Board of Directors is appointed by the shareholders and is 
ultimately responsible for the company’s organization and the 
management of the company’s affairs in the best interests of 
both Boliden and its shareholders  Under the provisions of the 
articles of association, the Board of Directors must comprise a 
minimum of three and a maximum of ten members, excluding 
deputies, elected by the AGM  Employees have a statutory 
right to appoint three members and three deputies to the 
Since the AGM of 2023, the Board, which is elected for one year 
at a time, has comprised seven members elected by the AGM 
and three members appointed by the trade union organi-
zations  Board meetings are attended both by the ordinary 
members and by the deputies  The President and CEO and the 
CFO are the Group management members who usually attend  
Other members of Group management and other executives 
also attend and present reports on specialist issues as required  
The General Counsel, Group Legal Affairs, is the Secretary of 
The Board members elected by the AGM are all independent 
in relation to major shareholders, the company and Group 
management  Thus the Board complies with the requirements 
of the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance with regard 
to independent members  The members of the Board are 
presented on pages 74 and 75 and on our company website  
The Board sets the company’s financial targets and strategy, 
appoints and evaluates the President and CEO  It ensures that 
efficient systems are in place for monitoring and controlling 
operations, that statutory and regulatory requirements are 
complied with and that information is published in a correct 
and transparent manner  At the statutory board meeting held 
every year immediately after the AGM, the Board adopts rules 
of procedure that govern its work and responsibilities in more 
detail  The allocation of duties between the Board and the 
President and CEO is set out in the instructions to the Presi-
dent and CEO adopted by the Board at the statutory board 
The Chairman supervises the Board’s work and ensures an 
open, constructive dialogue  The Chairman’s duties also 
include monitoring and evaluating the expertise and work of 
individual Board members and their contribution to the Board  
The Board and its work are evaluated annually and the results 
of the evaluation are conveyed to the Nomination Committee  
The evaluation is carried out by the Board under the super-
vision of the Chairman or with the help of an independent 
consultant  The 2023 evaluation was conducted by using an 
established Board evaluation platform (BoardClick) in which 
the members answered questions on a range of different top-
ics concerning the Board’s work  This also gave an opportunity 
for the members of the Board to express what they would like 
to learn more about to develop in their assignments  
An important part of the Chairman’s work is to act as an inter-
locutor and support for the President and CEO and to make 
sure that the Board’s decisions, instructions and directives are 
complied with and carried out  Prior to every Board meet-
ing, the Chairman and the President and CEO prepare and 
review the agenda items for the respective Board meeting  
Documentation in the form of memorandums on the topics on 
the agenda is sent to Board members one week ahead of each 
Board meeting and followed up by supporting slides and oral 
The Board held 14 meetings in 2023, including the statutory 
board meeting and 7 extra board meetings  The unusually 
large number of extra Board meetings in 2023 was partly due 
to the introduction of a long-term incentive program and, 
more importantly, by the events relating to the fire at the 
Rönnskär smelter and some other significant events requiring 
board assessment or decisions  The Board receives information 
on a continuous basis through monthly reports tracking the 
company’s performance with respect to safety, sustainability, 
and results  In addition to the monthly reports, the Board is 
provided with detailed information on the company’s devel-
opment at each Board meeting  Every regular meeting begins 
with a review of the operations of both business areas including 
production, sales, projects and investments, macro data 
outlook and industry trends, metal prices, treatment charges, 
demand for the company’s products, financial performance, 
rules and regulations affecting the company, possible chal-
lenges or risks that have been identified, and other relevant 
topics from time to time  In addition to these recurring topics, 
there are also a number of thematic items that are decided by 
the Board at the beginning of each year to highlight specific 
areas where the Board wishes to have special focus or to gain 
Given the nature of the operations, an important part of the 
Board’s focus at each meeting is sustainability related topics 
and metrics such as the development of lost time injuries (work 
related accidents) and sick leave, emission levels and targets, 
permit and license to operate issues  In addition to recurrent 
follow-ups, these issues are also the subject of discussions and 
considerations linked to specific projects or investments and 
In 2023, we continued our efforts to achieve our vision of 
becoming the most climate-friendly and respected metal 
provider in the world, and sustainability related initiatives and 
decisions were high on the agenda of the Board and manage-
ment  The issues that were in focus during the year included 
expanding and building on our green metals portfolio, 
transforming iron silicate into cement products, biodiversi-
ty, indigenous people and communities, sustainable waste 
management, emissions, the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi), as well as continued work and investments in dam safety 
In general, all of our operations are subject to permits  Permit 
application processes in recent years have become more 
complex, protracted and difficult to predict with appeals at 
several levels  Issues concerning important permits and license 
to operate on acceptable terms are the subject of ongoing 
We also monitor the general trends and developments in the 
sustainability field to ensure the best possible conditions for 
mining and smelting industries  We have been promoting an 
awareness that our metals, in particular copper and nickel, are 
essential for the green transition and that responsible mining 
activities can be carried out in Natura 2000 areas  Advocacy 
programs are pursued mainly through the European industry 
associations Eurometaux and Euromines, and with the help 
of domestic industry associations such as Svemin  The Board 
is informed on an ongoing basis about relevant national and 
international initiatives and proposed rules and regulations in 
the field of sustainability that may affect or be relevant for our 
operations  These initiatives or rules are presented to the Board 
by means of in-depth analyses to promote better understand-
ing and knowledge, and thereby well-informed decisions  The 
sustainability related topics that were subject to these in-depth 
presentations in 2023 related to dam safety, Green Transition 
Metals, biodiversity and the management of slag and waste, as 
shown in the table illustrating this year’s Board meetings  
Due to the fire at our Rönnskär smelter, the Board further 
increased its focus on risk management and contingency 
The overall responsibility of the Board cannot be delegated  
However, the Board may set up internal committees to address 
issues in defined areas  Thus, as in previous years, the Board 
set up an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee  
Committee members are appointed at the statutory Board 
meeting held after the AGM  Their work is governed by the 
The Audit Committee prepares certain accounting and fi-
nance-related issues for consideration by the Board and there-
by supports the Board in the fulfillment of its responsibilities 
within the areas of internal control and confirming the quality 
of financial reporting  The company has an internal control de-
partment that works with identifying and following up on risk 
areas  The Audit Committee also monitors the procurement of 
services from the company’s auditors in addition to the audit 
and where necessary it submits proposals to the Nomination 
Committee regarding the election of auditors  As of 2023, the 
Audit Committee has also been engaged in monitoring the 
company’s work with implementation of the CSRD report-
ing standards  The committee meets prior to each quarterly 
financial report and also as necessary  The Audit Committee 
comprises Pia Rudengren (Chair), Karl-Henrik Sundström and 
The committee members have specialist competence, expe-
rience of and interest in financial and accounting issues; see 
Board assignments and previous positions, pages 74 and 75  
The committee’s meetings are also attended by the Group’s 
Executive Vice President and CFO and the Head of Internal 
Control  The committee held five meetings in 2023  During the 
year, special attention was paid to internal controls, environ-
mental reclamation-related accounting matters and IT secu-
rity  The Audit Committee works according to the instructions 
for the Audit Committee adopted annually, and it reports the 
outcome of its work to the Board on an ongoing basis 
The Remuneration Committee submits proposals for resolu-
tion to the Board regarding remuneration and other terms of 
employment for the President and CEO, and follows up on and 
evaluates programs for variable remuneration for the Group 
management team  The committee also approves proposals 
regarding salaries and other terms of employment for Group 
management, as proposed by the President and CEO  Also, 
the Remuneration Committee draws up proposals regarding 
remuneration principles for the President and CEO and the 
Group management for subsequent submission by the Board 
to the AGM for resolution  The application of the guidelines 
and relevant remuneration structures and levels in the com-
pany are also followed up by the committee, and the results of 
this evaluation are published on the company website  During 
2023, the Remuneration Committee initiated the work to set 
up a long-term share-based incentive program for a smaller 
Recurring matters dealt with at each Board meeting: Sustainability and 
safety issues, review of operations, investments, cost control and specific in-
depth thematic items  Listed below are the principal agenda items for 2023’s 
group of senior employees  The suggestion to set up such a 
program was approved by the Annual General Meeting of 
shareholders  See note 5 for an account of the remuneration 
The Remuneration Committee works according to the instruc-
tions for the Remuneration Committee adopted annually, and 
it reports the results of its work to the Board  Following the 
statutory meeting in April, the Remuneration Committee com-
prises Karl-Henrik Sundström (Chair) and Per Lindberg  During 
the year, the committee held six meetings, which is more than 
during a normal committee year, related to the development 
The President and CEO has the ultimate responsibility for 
Boliden’s day-to-day business, strategic direction, compliance 
with and implementation of the Board’s decisions, and for 
ensuring that risk management, control systems, organization 
and processes are all satisfactory  The President and CEO 
is supported in his work by the Group’s management team 
which, in addition to the President and CEO, comprises the 
presidents of Boliden’s two business areas, Mines and Smelters, 
the CFO, and the Executive Vice President People and Sustain-
ability  Group management meets at least once a month to 
follow up on operations and discuss groupwide issues, draw 
up proposals for strategic plans, business plans and budgets, 
which the President and CEO then presents to the Board for 
Group management meets once a year to discuss strategy 
planning  Group management and the management of the 
respective business areas also meet four times a year to review 
business area specific issues, including a review of budgets and 
operations  For large-scale projects, special steering groups 
are formed, which regularly meet with project managers and 
other stakeholders  Furthermore, the President and CEO and 
Executive Vice President People and Sustainability meet with 
the company’s employee representative Board members and 
deputies before every Board meeting, to discuss the agenda 
and other issues of current interest  See page 76 for a presen-
The President and CEO is together with his or her Group man-
agement team responsible for implementing the decisions of 
the Board of Directors  This is done by delegation of duties to 
the operating units  These delegation frameworks are defined 
in Boliden’s policy documents, budget and strategic plan  The 
policy documents are available on the internal management 
system and include the Code of Conduct and a number of pol-
icies, including financial, tax, anti-corruption, competition law, 
market abuse/insiders, sanctions and anti-money laundering, 
whistleblowing, delegation and decision making, third party 
due diligence and the Business Partner Code of Conduct, com-
munications, privacy and personal data management (GDPR), 
and a wide range of environmental, health and safety related 
Boliden’s sustainability work is based on the topics that are 
most important for the operations  These topics are managed 
by the Board through the President and CEO and Group 
management to the operational units  The Executive Vice 
President People and Sustainability, who is a member of Group 
management, is dedicated to topics that are related to People 
and Sustainability  The day-to-day responsibility for sustain-
ability matters is decentralized to the respective units  Group 
functions in People and Sustainability (Sustainability Control, 
HR, Health and Safety, Ethics and Compliance, Communica-
tions, Environment and Quality) are responsible for develop-
ing structure and direction for the work, monitoring trends, 
promoting best practice sharing and coordinating the work in 
the units  They report to the Executive Vice President People 
Sustainability topics are followed up and discussed at all Group 
management meetings, Board meetings and local manage-
ment meetings  The most important sustainability topics are 
integrated into our strategy  Every sustainability topic has a 
long-term direction that guides and structures the work at 
every level in the company  Priorities are based on applicable 
regulations and the terms and conditions in our operating 
licenses but also the impact our operations have on people, 
the environment and society, expectations from internal and 
external stakeholders, risks and opportunities and relevant 
external trends  Boliden has committed to the UN Global Com-
pact, UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the principles 
of International Council on Metals and Mining (ICMM) 
We also support Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) and we have a management system 
that complies with the ISO standards for the environment, 
quality, energy and occupational health and safety  Important 
sustainability topics are also covered through participation in 
European and national industry organizations  As prioritized 
challenges and opportunities change over time, materiality 
assessments are held regularly, usually once a year, in which 
representatives from the business units and Group functions 
Sustainability is integrated in the strategy work, and each 
business area is responsible for setting local targets based on 
the Group’s sustainability guidelines  Our sustainability work is 
value based, which means that action plans are not only deter-
mined based on legislation and regulatory requirements, but 
also on needs and identified activities that can improve the sit-
uation for people, the environment and our local communities  
This means that investments with major environmental or safe-
ty benefits in relation to the amount invested are implemented 
independently of external requirements or obligations 
Boliden’s Sustainable Finance Committee (SFC) was es-
tablished in 2022 with the purpose to further integrate our 
sustainability and financing, and to ensure transparency 
and responsibility regarding sustainable financing  The SFC 
is responsible for the evaluation and selection process for 
financing under Boliden’s Green Financing Framework to be 
adopted  The SFC is led by the Director of Treasury and consists 
of representatives from the business areas and relevant Group 
functions  The committee reports to Group management and 
The implementation of Boliden’s values and leader and 
co-worker principles, developed by a large number of em-
ployees from all business units in 2020–2021, continued during 
2023  The purpose is to further strengthen the company’s 
Business ethics is another important area that is always high on 
the company’s agenda  The ethics and compliance function is 
responsible for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations 
concerning anti-corruption, competition, trade sanctions, 
money laundering, data privacy, human rights, whistleblowing, 
business partner due diligence and Boliden’s Code of Conduct  
The new, more ambitious climate targets adopted in 2022 were 
validated and approved by the SBTi at the end of 2023 
The sustainability report has been included in the annual re-
port since 2017  The Group also compiles a Sustainability Index 
containing detailed sustainability information and reports this 
according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the UN Global Compact, 
The Sustainability Index is subject to external audit, aiming to 
emphasize the importance of sustainability work and further 
strengthen the trust among all our stakeholders regarding 
The new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) 
will apply to Boliden as of the fiscal year 2024, and the outcome 
will be reported in the Annual and Sustainability Report for 
2024, to be released during the spring of 2025  Boliden is run-
ning a project to achieve compliance  The double materiality 
assessment was performed during 2023 to define the scope of 
The external auditor conducts independent audits of accounts 
to ensure that they provide an accurate, fair and compre-
hensive picture of the company’s position and economic 
performance in all material respects  The auditor also reviews 
the Board’s and the President and CEO’s administration and 
reports the findings to the Board  The auditor is in contact 
with Group management in conjunction with the audits or 
emerging issues  The auditor regularly attends Audit Commit-
tee meetings and meets with the Board once during the year 
The auditor also reports to the shareholders at the AGM  The 
auditing firm Deloitte AB was elected at the 2023 AGM to serve 
as the company’s auditors until the conclusion of the 2024 
AGM  Authorized public accountant Thomas Strömberg is auditor-in-charge  He is a partner at Deloitte Sweden and 
neration to the auditors is payable against approved invoices

The purpose of internal control over financial reporting is to 
provide reasonable assurance with regard to the reliability of 
the external financial reporting and to ensure that the reports 
are produced in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing principles, applicable legislation and statutes, and with 
other requirements imposed on listed companies  The Board 
has overall responsibility for ensuring that an effective internal 
control system exists within the Group  The President and CEO

The Group has an internal control function responsible for 
implementing processes and frameworks that safeguard in-
ternal control and ensure the quality of the financial reporting  
The internal control function reports to the Executive Vice 
President and CFO and presents reports on issues relating to 
internal control at the Audit Committee’s meetings 
The control environment is characterized by relatively few but 
large operating units that have long operated according to 
well-established processes and control activities  To ensure a 
uniform approach and working methods, there are binding 
policies and indicative guidelines for delegated responsibility 
within the organization  An internal control framework exists 
which includes Boliden’s Code of Conduct, decision-making 
and authorization instructions, and a financial manual covering 
financial policy, accounting and reporting instructions  In addi-
tion, there are local management systems with more detailed 
instructions and descriptions of important processes  The 
Group has a uniform, standardized internal control framework 
known as BICS, which includes both financial processes and 
The operating units conduct ongoing risk analyses with 
regard to financial reporting  The risks inherent in the various 
accounting and reporting processes are identified, analyzed 
Various types of control activities are carried out in all parts of 
the accounting and reporting process on an ongoing basis  
The control activities are carried out in order to manage known 
risks and to detect and rectify any errors and discrepancies in 
the financial reporting  Documentation of significant control 
activities in the accounting and reporting process continued 
in BICS in 2023  For every risk identified, the controls used to 
Information on policies, guidelines and manuals is available on

in Stockholm at the address: Klarabergsviadukten 90, SE-101 20 Stockholm, 
Sweden  The Boliden share is listed on Nasdaq Stockholm’s Large Cap list  
The Company is the Parent Company of the Boliden Group, whose 
principal operations involve the mining and production of metals and 
The Consolidated Statements have been compiled in accordance with 
the EU approved International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and 
interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC)  In addi-
tion, the Group applies the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recom-
mendation RFR 1 Supplementary accounting regulations for corporate 
conglomerates specifying the supplements to IFRS required pursuant to 
the stipulations of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act 
The Parent Company’s functional currency is the Swedish krona (SEK) 
and this is also the reporting currency for both the Group and the Parent 
Items have been valued at their historical cost in the consolidated 
accounts, with the exception of certain financial assets and liabilities 
(derivative instruments), which have been valued at their fair value, and 
inventories in those cases where they are hedged at fair value 
The Parent Company’s accounting principles follow those of the Group 
with the exception of the mandatory regulations stipulated in the 
Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s recommendation, RFR 2 Accounting 
for legal entities  The Parent Company’s accounting principles are pre-
sented under the heading “The Parent Company’s accounting principles” 
The most important accounting principles are presented in the note to 
which they are attributable  These principles have been applied consis-
tently for all years presented, unless otherwise specified

New standards from IASB, as well as interpretations and agenda 
decisions from IFRS IC that come into force in the 2024 calendar year 
New and amended standards, interpretations and agenda decisions that 
come into force for the financial year beginning on January 1, 2024 are not 
expected to have any significant impact on the Group’s financial statements 
The Consolidated Statements cover the Parent Company and all compa-
nies over which the Parent Company through ownership, directly or indi-
rectly, exercises a controlling influence  The term “controlling influence” 
refers to companies in which Boliden exerts influence, is exposed to, or is 
entitled to a variable return from its involvement and in which it can use 
its influence over the company to influence its return  This is generally 
achieved by ensuring that its ownership share, and the share of votes, 
exceeds 50 percent  The existence and effect of potential voting rights 
that can currently be utilized or converted are taken into account when 
assessing whether the Group is capable of exercising a controlling influ-
ence over another company  Subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated 
Statements as of the point in time at which a controlling influence has 
been attained, while companies that have been sold are included in the 
Consolidated Statements up to the time when the sale occurred, meaning 
up to the point in time when controlling influence ceased to apply 
The Consolidated Statements have been compiled in accordance with 
the acquisition accounting method, which means that the historical cost 
of a company comprises the fair value of the payment made (including 
the fair value of any assets, liabilities and equity instruments issued)  
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are 
reported at their fair value at the time of acquisition  In conjunction with 
every acquisition, a determination is made as to whether a non-con-
trolling interest should be reported at fair value or at the holding’s 
proportional share of the acquired company’s net assets  When required, 
the subsidiaries’ accounts are adjusted to ensure that they follow the 
same principles applied by other Group companies  All internal transac-
tions between Group companies and intra-Group balances are elimi-
nated when the Consolidated Statements are compiled 
Conversion of foreign subsidiaries and other overseas operations
The currency in the primary economic conditions in which the subsidiary 
companies operate is the functional currency  When consolidating to the 
reporting currency, the Balance Sheets for overseas subsidiary com-
panies are converted at the exchange rates applicable at the reporting 
period end, while the Income Statements are converted at the average 
exchange rates for the reporting period  Any exchange rate differences 
arising and accumulated translation differences in respect of the conver-
sion of subsidiaries are reported as Other comprehensive income 
Boliden hedges its net investments in foreign subsidiaries to some extent 
by taking an opposite position (in the form of loans) in the relevant 
foreign currency  Exchange rate differences on hedging measures are 
In conjunction with the sale of overseas operations whose functional 
currency is different from the Group’s reporting currency, the accumu-
lated translation differences attributable to the operations are realized in 
the Consolidated Income Statement, after deductions for any currency 
Receivables, liabilities and derivatives in foreign currencies are converted 
to SEK at the exchange rate applying on the closing day  Exchange rate 
differences on operating receivables and operating liabilities are included 
in the operating profit, while exchange rate differences on financial assets 
and liabilities are reported under financial items  Exchange rate effects on 
financial instruments used in cash flow hedging and the hedging of net 
investments in overseas operations, are reported under Other compre-
hensive income with the exception of any exchange rate differences on 
currency swaps in foreign currencies reported under net financial items 
The Parent Company’s annual accounts are compiled in accordance with 
the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board’s 
recommendation, RFR 2 Accounting for legal entities, and the statements 
issued by the Swedish Financial Reporting Board  Under RFR 2, the Parent 
Company must, in the accounts for the legal entity, apply all EU-approved 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and statements to the 
extent that this is possible within the framework of the Swedish Annual 
Accounts Act and with due regard to the connection between reporting 
and taxation  The recommendation specifies the exceptions and additions 
to be made in relation to IFRS  The differences between the Group’s and 
the Parent Company’s accounting principles are described below 
Reporting of Group contributions and shareholders’ contributions
Group contributions received or made are reported as appropriations  
Shareholders’ contributions are booked directly against non-restricted 
equity by the recipient and as an increase in the item Participations in 
Anticipated dividends can be reported in those cases where the ­

In order to compile the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 
accounting principles, assessments and assumptions must be made that 
impact the reported asset and liability amounts and the income and 
expense amounts, as well as other information provided in the financial 
statements  The estimates and assessments of the Board of Directors and 
the Company’s management are based on historical experience and future 
trend forecasts  The actual outcome may differ from these assessments 
Provisions for reclamations are made on the basis of an assessment 
of future costs based on current conditions  Provisions are reviewed 
regularly by internal and external specialists and updates are made when 
necessary when the estimated useful lives, costs, technical precondi-
tions, regulations or other conditions of mine and smelter assets change  
Provisions for reclamation work totaled SEK 10,890 m (7,040); see also 
Note 25, Other provisions  Capitalized reclamation costs totaled SEK 
7,695 m (4,180); see also Note 14, Property, plant and equipment  Net 
Boliden also has a responsibility for the reclamation of a number of 
decommissioned mines and continually reviews the requirement to make 
provisions in respect of these objects  Inspection of and risk assessments 
in relation to reclamation measures are conducted on a systematic basis 
In the event of supplementary reclamation work on a decommissioned 
mine being deemed necessary in order to comply with the require-
ments of external regulations, a provision is reported for the anticipated 
future costs  The provision is reviewed as investigations and action plans 
To determine the size of the reclamation liability, a real discount interest 
A change in the discount rate of 0 5 percentage points would result in an 
adjustment to the reclamation liability of approximately SEK 400 m and 
a corresponding change in capitalized reclamation costs  The depreci-
ations in the years ahead should be adjusted by around +/- SEK 20 m 
with the net financial items affected by the equivalent amount but in the 
In the smelters’ process inventories and stocks of finished metals, it is diffi-
cult to differentiate between externally purchased material and mined con-
centrate from the Group’s own operations  Consequently, calculating the 
internal profit of inventories and the reported value of process inventory 
entails estimation of the proportion of process inventory and finished metal 
inventory derives from internal mining operations, based on the quantities 
of mined concentrate produced internally and purchased externally  
Pension provisions are dependent on the assumptions made in conjunc-
tion with the calculations of the amounts  The assumptions refer to dis-
count interest rates, rate of salary increases, future increases in pensions, 
the number of remaining working years for employees, life expectancy, 
inflation and other factors, and are reviewed annually  The assumptions 
are made for every country in which Boliden has defined benefit pension 
plans  The most significant assumptions, in Boliden’s opinion, are with 
regard to the discount rate, the rate of salary increases, and life expec-
tancy, and Boliden has choosen to present sensitivity analysis for these 
factors  Boliden’s assumptions and sensitivity analysis are presented in 
Note 24, Provisions for pensions and similar obligations  
Boliden regularly analyses and evaluates outstanding legal disputes 
using internal company legal counsels and, when necessary, with the 
help of external advisors, in order to assess the need for provisions to be 
made  See Note 31, Pledged assets and contingent liabilities 
Impairment tests for property, plant and equipment and intangible assets 
are based on the Company’s internal business plan and on assumptions 
with regard to future trends in for instance metal prices, treatment and 
refining charges, and exchange rates  Changes in market prices of metals, 
treatment and refining charges and currencies have a substantial effect 
on the Group’s future cash flows and hence on the estimated impairment 
requirement  Assumptions with regard to price trends for metals, treat-
ment and refining charges and currencies are based on current consen-
sus prices in the market at the time of the impairment test  For further 
information, see Note 14, Property, plant and equipment 
The depreciation periods for deferred mining costs, installations and 
equipment in mines depend on future ore extraction and the lifespan of 
the mine  The assessment of these aspects is, in turn, heavily dependent 
on mineral reserves and, consequently, on factors such as anticipated 
future metal prices  The valuation is based on assumptions that the nec-
essary environmental permits will be obtained  Changes to conditions 
may entail changes to the rate of depreciation applied in future  Business 
Area Mines develops annual life of mine production plans for the mines 
Boliden’s Mineral Reserves are divided into two categories: probable 
and proven  The assessment is based on geological measurements 
and assumptions that are explained in greater detail on pages 48–52  
Boliden’s assessment of the size of the Mineral Reserves affects annual 
depreciation costs and impairment tests for intangible assets and prop-
Boliden is organized into two segments: Business Area 
Mines and Business Area Smelters  The Business Areas 
correspond to Boliden’s operating segments in that 1) the 
Business Area Managers are directly responsible to the CEO, 
2) the CEO controls the Group’s operating units via two 
Business Area Boards, one for each Business Area, through 
which the financial results are evaluated in relation to finan-
cial targets, 3) financial targets as well as investment plans 
and overhead budgets for the respective Business Areas are 
set in the business plan and budget process, 4) decisions on 
targets and resource allocation for units within the respec-
tive Business Areas are made within the respective Business 
Areas’ management groups, and 5) General Managers of 
operating units report not to the CEO but to the Business 
Business Area Mines comprises the operations of the 
Swedish mines Aitik, the Boliden Area and Garpenberg, 
the Tara mine in Ireland, and the Kevitsa mine in Finland  
Business Area Mines is also responsible for sales of mined 
Business Area Smelters includes the Kokkola and Odda zinc 
smelters in Finland and Norway, respectively, the Rönnskär 
and Harjavalta copper smelters in Sweden and Finland, 
respectively, and the Bergsöe lead smelter in Sweden  The 
Business Area is responsible for all sales of the smelters’ 
products and handles all raw material flows between the 
Group’s mines, smelters and customers  This includes 
responsibility for purchases of metal concentrates and recy-
cling materials from external suppliers  The copper smelters 
also recycle metal and electronic scrap and smelt nickel  The 
Bergsöe lead smelter recycles lead metal, mainly from scrap 
Transactions between the Business Areas, primarily involv-
ing metal concentrates, are settled on an arms’ length basis

The Group’s metal concentrates are invoiced provisionally 
upon delivery  Definitive invoicing takes place when all rele-
vant parameters have been determined (concentrate, quan-

from the provisional invoicing are reported at the metal

Salaries and other remuneration broken down by country, Board Members etc  and other employees
A profit-sharing system was introduced for all Boliden Group 
employees in 2007  A profit share is payable when the return on 
capital employed exceeds 8 percent, and the maximum profit 
share (SEK 40,000/full-time employee) is payable when the return 
on capital employed reaches 18 percent  However, the annual 
maximum allocation may never exceed one-third of the dividend 
paid to shareholders  The funds may be disbursed to the employ-
ees after three years at the earliest unless otherwise regulated by 
the relevant national profit-sharing scheme  An allocation of SEK 
16,280 (30,000) per full-time employee is proposed for 2023 as the 
return on capital employed was 12 1 percent (26 6)  However, this 
is conditional upon the dividend resolution by the Annual General 
Meeting  In 2023 the maximum profit share has been increased 
REMUNERATION PAID TO BOARD MEMBERS AND SENIOR EXECUTIVES
Fees as approved by the Annual General Meeting are payable to 
the Chairman of the Board and to Board Members  The President 
and employee representatives do not receive director fees 
Remuneration paid to the President and other senior executives 
comprises basic salary, variable remuneration, other benefits and 
pension  The term senior executives refers to those persons who 
have made up the Group management during the year  At year-
end, Group management comprised five members, including the 
President  All members of Group management are employed in 
The split between basic salary and variable remuneration shall 
be in proportion to the executive’s responsibilities and authority  
variable remuneration is maximized to 60 percent of the basic 
salary for the President, while for other senior executives, it is max-

contribution pension plans to which the company sets 
aside 30 percent of the fixed monthly salary  The premium 
does not include costs for ITP basic level, ITPK, part-time 
retirement pension and supplementary health insurance  
The President and the company shall give six and twelve 
months’ notice of termination respectively  If notice is 
given by the company, severance pay corresponding to 
six months’ salary is payable, in addition to pay during the 
period of notice  Other income shall be deducted from 
period of six months if they give notice themselves  If 
notice of termination is given by the company, the period 
of notice is six to twelve months  In addition, severance pay

from severance pay  No severance pay is payable in the case 
Boliden has a share-based incentive program in the form 
of a long-term share savings program  The cost of the 
program is recognized based on the fair value per share 
right at the time of grant, calculated by an independent 
third party, and the number of shares expected to be 
earned  This remuneration is recognized as personnel costs 
during the vesting period, with an equivalent increase in 
equity  To the extent the vesting terms in the program are 
connected to market-related performance conditions (total 
shareholder return, TSR), these are taken into consider-
ation when calculating the fair value of the share rights  
Performance conditions as well as employment conditions 
(continued employment) impact personnel costs during the 
vesting period through changes in the number of shares 
expected at the end of the program  At the end of each 
reporting period, the Group reviews its assessment of the 
number of shares that are expected to be earned based on 
the performance conditions and employment conditions  
When shares are allocated, social security contributions are 
to be recognized in certain countries for the value of the 
employee benefit  The Group continuously recognizes a 
liability for social security contributions for these remuner-
ations  The liability is revalued continuously based on the 
fair value of the share-based remuneration on the Balance 
On April 25, 2023, the Annual General Meeting passed 
a resolution to implement a long-term share savings 
program, LTIP 2023/2026 aimed at the CEO, members of 
the Group Management, general managers and certain 
other key employees in the Boliden Group  The overall 
purpose of the share savings program is to maintain a close 
community of interest between employees and sharehold-
ers by incentivizing employees to increase the value of the 
company  The program is intended to attract and retain key 
The program is share-based and builds on the participants 
buying shares – investment shares – in the market  Subject 
to certain conditions, the participants are allotted up to 
three performance shares free of charge for each invest-
ment share purchased  The number of investment shares 
allocated is linked to a certain percentage of the partici-
pant’s annual fixed base salary in 2023  Performance shares 
are awarded after a period of three years  The total number 
of performance shares comprises a maximum of 40,000  
The program encompasses a maximum of 17 participants  
The allotment of performance shares is conditional to 
continued employment and an uninterrupted holding of 
allocated investment shares  In addition, two performance 
conditions are set, one financial and one sustainability 
The financial condition is linked to the total return for 
Boliden’s share (TSR)  The TSR development in 2023 com-
pared with 2026 should exceed that of a peer group of other 
companies  The measurement period is 20 trading days 
after Boliden’s publication of the year-end report each year  
For maximum allotment of performance shares, Boliden’s 
TSR must exceed that of the peer group by at least 12 5 
The sustainability condition relates to the reduction of 
Boliden’s carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms  A con-
dition for allotment of performance shares is that Boliden’s 
carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the 
financial year 2025 have been reduced by at least 12 percent 
compared to Boliden’s carbon dioxide emissions in absolute 
The financial condition is weighted with 80% and the sus-
tainability condition with 20 percent when determining the 
The grant date for the long-term share savings program was 
In accordance with the terms and conditions, Boliden’s 
Group Management and certain other key employees in the 
Group, a total of 15 people, have acquired or already hold 
11,672 shares  LTIP 2023/2026 may comprise a maximum of 
35,016 performance shares in Boliden  To ensure delivery of 
shares under LTIP 2023/2026, Boliden AB has on 20 October 
2023 repurchased 40,000 shares, for a total amount of SEK 
11 m  As the total number of shares in Boliden amounts to 
273,511,169, this corresponds to 0 002 percent of the total 
number of shares  The cost for the program, excluding 
social security contributions, is reported based on the fair 
value per share right at the time of allotment, amounting 
to SEK 180 4, and the estimated number of shares that will 
be vested  Total cost for the year 2023 amounted to SEK 1 4

Government support refers to subsidies, grants or premiums 
designed to provide an economic benefit, or Government support 
in the form of transfers of resources to the company in exchange 
for the latter’s meeting or agreeing to meet certain future con-
ditions  Government support attributable to assets is reported 
either by recognizing the support as a prepaid income or by 
reducing the reported value of the asset  Other contributions are 
recognized as other income, or as a reduction in costs during the 
same reporting period the contributions are intended to cover  
The costs involved are personnel costs and energy costs 
Government subsidies totaling SEK 530 m (246) were received in 
2023, SEK 226 m (182) was reported in the Income Statement, and 
the asset’s value was reduced by SEK 252 m (60)  The majority of 
the subsidies were received in Norway under a carbon dioxide 
compensation scheme and for energy efficiency improvement 
measures, and in Finland in respect of electrification support, and 
are reported under cost of goods sold in the Income Statement

Boliden’s R&D primarily comprises exploration  Boliden is also 
involved, to a limited extent, in developing mining and smelting 
processes  Expenses associated with research and development 
are primarily booked as costs when they arise, and are reported 
under the item “Research and development costs” in the Income 
Statement  When the financial potential for the exploitation of a 
mine deposit has been confirmed, the expenses are booked as 
costs up to that date  After that date, the expenses are capitalized 
as deferred mining costs, whose principles are described in Note 
14, Property, plant and equipment  Exploration rights acquired in 
conjunction with business acquisitions have been capitalized as 
Acquired exploration rights are assessed to have an indefinite 
useful life as there is no predictable limit on the time during 
which the asset is expected to generate net payments to Boliden  
Impairment testing in respect of exploration rights is carried out in 
accordance with IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral 
Resources, and impairment testing is, therefore, only carried out in 
the presence of an indication that the need to write down an asset 
Intangible assets also include patents, licenses and similar rights  
They are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
Goodwill arises at the time of acquisition when the historical cost 
exceeds the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net 
assets of the subsidiary company  Goodwill is reported in the 
Balance Sheet at the value given in conjunction with the acqui-
converted, where relevant, at the closing day rate, after 
deduction for accumulated impairments  Calculations of the profit 
or loss on the sale of a unit include any remaining reported good-
Goodwill has been assessed as having an indefinite useful life  
Goodwill is allocated to the smallest possible unit or group of units 
that generate cash where separate cash flows can be identified, 
and an impairment test is performed on the reported value at 
least once a year to determine whether there is any need for an 
impairment  Such impairment tests are, however, performed more 
frequently if there are indications that the value may have fallen 
The Boliden Group participates in the European system for emis-
sion rights  Rights are allocated across the European market  One 
emission right grants entitlement to emit the equivalent of one 
tonne of carbon dioxide or similar gas and is classified as an intan-
gible asset  Allocated emission rights are valued at the historical 
cost of zero, while rights acquired are valued at the purchase price  
An intangible asset and a provision in the corresponding amount 
are reported during the current year in the event of any need 
arising to purchase additional emission rights  The asset is amor-
tized over the remaining months of the year, thereby distributing 
the cost in line with production  The intangible asset is thereby 
exhausted and the provision for emissions made is adjusted  If the 
liability to deliver emission rights exceeds the remaining emission 
rights allocation, the liability is revalued at the market value of the 
number of emission rights required to clear the undertaking on 
On each reporting occasion, an assessment is performed to 
determine whether there is any indication of impairment in respect 
of the Group’s assets  Should this be the case, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is calculated  Goodwill, together with any 
intangible assets with indefinable useful lives, is subject to annual 
impairment tests even if there are no indications of a reduction 
in its value  The recoverable amount comprises whichever is the 
higher of the value in use of the asset in the operations and the 
value that would result if the asset were sold to an independent 
party, fair value minus selling expenses  The value in use com-
prises the present value of all incoming and outgoing payments 
attributable to the asset for the duration of its expected use in 
the operations, plus the present value of the net sales value at the 
end of the asset’s useful life  The period during which use of the 
asset is expected to be possible is based on the assumption that 
the necessary environmental permits can be obtained  If the esti-
mated recoverable amount is lower than the book value, the latter 
Impairments are reported in the Income Statement  Any impair-
ment is reversed if changes in the assumptions leading to the orig-
inal impairment mean that the impairment is no longer warranted  
Impairments that have been performed are not reversed in such a 
way that the reported value exceeds the amount that would, fol-
lowing deductions for depreciation and amortization according to 
plan, have been reported if no impairment had been performed  
Reversals of impairments are reported in the Income Statement  
Goodwill impairments are not reversed  See also the section in

The Group’s goodwill item arose primarily in conjunction 
with the acquisition of the operations from Outokumpu at 
sition has principally been allocated to the Group’s Smelters 
segment  Impairment tests have been carried out on the 
goodwill value as described in Note 14 under Impairment 
The Boliden Group did not sell any emission rights in 2023 
During 2022, a resolution was passed to close the explora-

Land, plants and equipment and associated capitalized costs for 
development and pre-production measures, are booked at histor-

acquisition value  Repair and maintenance expenses are booked 
as costs, while substantial improvements and replacements are 
Estimated future expenses for the dismantling and removal of a 
tangible asset and the restoration of a site or area where the tangi-
ble asset is located (reclamation costs) are capitalized  Capitalized 
amounts comprise estimated expenses, calculated at current 
value, which are simultaneously reported as provisions  Effects of 
subsequent events that result in costs that exceed the provision 
are discounted, capitalized as a tangible asset and increase the 
provisions, and are depreciated over the remaining life of the 
Deferred mining costs at mines comprise the waste rock excava-
tion required to access the ore body, work relating to infrastruc-
tural facilities, roads, tunnels, shafts and inclined drifts, as well as 
service, electricity and air distribution facilities  Deferred mining 
costs arising from expanding the capacity of the mining opera-
tion, the development of new ore bodies, and the preparation of 
mining areas for future ore production are capitalized  Mining 
costs arising from waste rock removal from open pit mines are 
capitalized as part of an asset when it becomes possible to identify 
the part of an ore body to which access has been improved  
Depreciation principles for Property, plant and equipment
Depreciation according to plan is based on the original capitalized 
values and the estimated useful life, and begins when an asset is 
Plants and capitalized values attributable to waste rock are 
depreciated by pushback and in conjunction with metal extraction 
relation to the anticipated metal extraction for the entire push-
back  Plants and capitalized values included in deferred mining 
costs are depreciated in accordance with a production-based 
depreciation method that is based on the Proven and Probable 
Mineral Reserves in the respective ore bodies  Depreciation is 
effected to the estimated residual value  Estimated residual values 
and production capacity are subject to ongoing review  Plant not 
directly linked to production capacity is depreciated on the basis 
of its anticipated lifespan  The estimated useful life is based on 
the assumption that the necessary environmental permits can be 
Smelters and production plants are depreciated linearly over their 
The following depreciation periods are applied to Property, plant 
and equipment, including future reclamation costs: Buildings	
Boliden applies component depreciation, which means that larger 
processing facilities are broken down into component parts with 
different useful lives and thus different depreciation periods 
Capitalized reclamation costs include expenses in relation to the 
dismantling and removal of assets and the restoration of the sites 
where the assets are located  Accumulated capitalized reclamation 
costs total SEK 9,114 m (5,300)  Accumulated depreciation totals 
SEK -1,419 m (-1,119)  The change in capitalized reclamation costs 
for the year total SEK 3,815 m (382)  The change for the year is 
mainly attributable to Aitik and Garpenberg, see more information 
in Note 25, Provisions  The change is reported in accordance with 
IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and 
Similar Liabilities  Reclamation costs for the year are not included 
in the consolidated key ratios for the year’s investments, and have 
no effect on the Group’s cash flow  Investments in property, plant 
and equipment include leases according to IFRS 16 Leases, totaling 
SEK 28 m (106); see also Note 15, Leases  The same principle for 
key ratios, cash flow and reclamation costs for the year, applies to 
Capitalized interest expenses included in planned residual value

Annual impairment test – Intangible assets and Property, plant and equipment
Impairment tests are carried out yearly, or throughout the year if 
an event occurs that may result in an impairment requirement, and 
are based on the Group’s annual budget and strategic planning 
work  The planning horizon is the estimated lifespan of each mine, 
based on the existing mineral reserve, usually between 5 to 30 
years  Smelters establishes plans for 10 years  Boliden’s operations 
are characterized by long-term production plans in which every 
mine has set production plans for the entire estimated life­
of the mine in question, while a substantial part of the smelters’ 
concentrate supply is regulated by means of long-term delivery 
agreements  The plans also include assessments of environmental 
issues based on external analyses, risks and opportunities  The 
most important environmental issues are included in the strategic 
work, where targets, metrics and activity plans are clarified  
Investments shall be assessed on the basis of environmental 
impact and be in support of Boliden’s business strategy of being 
a prioritized metal supplier for a sustainable society  Production 
plans are based on the assumption that the permits needed to 
conduct the operations can be obtained and, where necessary, 
renewed  This long-term production planning also allows the use 
of long-term cash flow forecasts  Additional growth assumptions 
are not included in extrapolated cash flow forecasts beyond the 
planning horizon, which means that smelters’ cash flows from year 
eleven onwards are extrapolated using year ten as a base, after 
The value of discounted cash flows is highly sensitive to metal 
prices, treatment and refining charges (TC/RC), and exchange 
rates (see sensitivity table in Note 28)  The present value of esti-
mated future cash flows is based on current consensus prices, i e  
a joint market assessment  Current consensus prices are available 
through compilations from a number of analysis firms  
The current consensus prices used in the impairment test are 
Individual mines or mining areas with centralized concentrating 
facilities, copper smelters, zinc smelters, Boliden Bergsöe AB 
and Boliden Commercial AB are classified as cash-generating 
units  The discounted real cash flows before tax for the relevant 
cash-generating units are compared with the book value of capital 
employed  The cash flows are discounted with a real discount rate 
before tax of 9 percent (9), which corresponds to the weighted 
average capital cost  The Group’s goodwill is allocated to segment 
Smelters, rather than to cash-generating units, in accordance with 
monitoring of goodwill  The value in use of the Group’s assets is 
estimated to exceed the carrying amount of all cash-generating 
units  The Tara zinc mine book value, EUR 215 m, is marginally 
below the estimated value in use  The Tara zinc mine is currently 
put in care and maintenance since July 2023  The estimated value 
in use is based on the mine being restarted in 2024  The value of 
Tara is continuously monitored in terms of metal prices, exchange 
rates and treatment charges for zinc  In the case of the completed 
sensitivity analysis presented below, Tara demonstrates sensitivity 
 An increase in the discount rate by one percentage point would 
have led to a need for impairment of one cash-generating unit 
in the Mines segment, the Tara mine  A 10 percent reduction of 
all current consensus prices for metals would not lead to any 
need for impairment in the Smelters segment, but for the Mines 
segment, such a reduction would mean that the book value would 
exceed the discounted cash flows in respect of the Tara mine and 
Boliden Area  If current consensus prices for metals were to remain 
unchanged, a 10 percent weakening of the US dollar against all 
other currencies would not require an impairment requirement for 
segment Mines or Smelters  The calculation does not include any 
compensatory movements in metal prices, TC/RC, or the prices 
of by-products or input goods, which has historically often been 
the case  A 10 percent fall in TC/RC for all metals would not result 
in any impairment requirement in the Smelters segment; in the 
Mines segment, the same reduction would have a positive effect 
The lease agreements are recognized as right-of-use assets 
and equivalent liabilities, and reported on the day the 
tion of the liability for a leased asset is based on the current 
value of the remaining lease charges, discounted by the 
implicit borrowing rate  If this cannot be determined, the 
discounting takes place instead using the marginal borrow-
ing rate  The liability is recognized under Other interest-­
bearing liabilities, split between a current and a non-current 
part  Each lease payment is distributed between amortiza-
tion of the debt and financial expense  The financial cost is 
distributed over the lease period so that each accounting 
period is burdened with an amount corresponding to a fixed 
interest rate for the liability reported during the relevant 
period  The right-of-use assets is initially valued at historical 
cost, which is made up of the sum of the lease liability, any 
direct expenses and reclamation costs  The right-of-use 
recognized as Property, plant and equipment in the 
Balance Sheet, broken down between the items Buildings 
Group’s lease agreements comprise various properties, 
land, mining and service machinery, concentrate stores and 
excavators  The lease contracts vary in length, although the 
agreement and vary  The leased assets may not be used 
as collateral for loans  Some agreements contain variable 
lease payments that are based on an index or interest rate  
Changes to the index first affect the lease liability in the 
period when cash flow from the change occurs  At this time, 
the lease liability is recalculated and adjusted against the 
right-of-use asset  The option of extending an agreement 
is included in a few of the Group’s leases for vehicles and 
equipment, and has not been included in the lease liability 
because the Group does not consider it reasonably certain 
that these options will be exercised  Revaluation of lease 
liability is carried out for example in the event of amended 
assessments of the utilization of options as well as amended 
assessments of the outcome of residual value guarantees 
A lease agreement running for less than 12 months, known 
as a short-term lease, or a lease that relates to the lease of a 
low-value asset, is exempt and is not included when deter-
mining liability and right-of-use assets, rather these are 
booked linearly in the item Cost of goods sold in the Income 
Statement  This also applies to agreements with variable 
pricing, such as certain transport agreements  Low value 
leases include IT equipment, office equipment and the hire 
of building modules  See also Note 29, Maturity structure

Additional right-of-use assets totaled SEK 28 m (106)

The tax expense (income) for the period comprises current tax and 
deferred tax  Tax is reported in the Income Statement, Other com-
prehensive income or Equity, depending on where the underlying 
Current tax is the tax calculated on the taxable profit/loss for 
each period  The year’s taxable profit/loss differs from the year’s 
reported profit/loss before tax in that it has been adjusted for 
non-taxable and non-deductible items and temporary differences  
current tax liability is calculated in accordance with 
Deferred tax is reported using the Balance Sheet method, under 
which deferred tax liabilities are reported in the Balance Sheet for 
all taxable temporary differences between reported and fiscal 
values of assets and liabilities  Deferred tax assets are reported 
in the Balance Sheet in respect of tax losses carried-forward and 
all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is likely 
that these amounts can be used to offset future taxable surpluses  
The reported value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end 
of each accounting period and reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer likely that sufficient taxable surpluses will be available for its 
use  Deferred tax is calculated in accordance with the tax rates that 
are expected to apply to the period in which the asset is recovered 
Both deferred and current tax receivables and tax liabilities are 
offset when they relate to income tax levied by the same tax

The Group has assessed its potential exposure to Pillar 2 
income taxes  Applying the temporary relief rules, the so-called 
“Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour”, the Group has performed 
calculations based on its Country-by-Country reporting for 2023  
According to the calculations, all companies within the Group 
qualify for the Transitional CbCR Safe Harbour in 2023, and there 
are no circumstances that indicate that this will change in the 
coming year  The Group therefore expects no exposure to Pillar 2

The Group’s inventories primarily comprise mine concentrates, 
materials tied up in the smelters’ production processes and 
finished metals  Inventories are valued at whichever is the lower

ciple and the net realizable value, taking into account the risk of 
obsolescence  The historical cost of inventories of metals from the 
company’s mines and semi-finished and finished products manu-
factured in house comprises the direct manufacturing costs plus 
a surcharge for indirect manufacturing costs  Supplies inventories 
are valued at whichever is the lower of the average historical cost 
and the replacement value  When mine concentrates are bought in 
from external sources and definitive pricing has not yet occurred,

The Group’s companies have a variety of pension systems in 
accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries in 
which they operate  These are generally financed through pay-
ments made to insurance companies or through the company’s 
own provisions, which are determined through periodic actuarial 
calculations  The Group’s provisions for pension commitments are 
calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits 
For pension systems where the employer is committed to defined 
contribution systems, the obligation in relation to the employee 
ceases when the agreed premiums have been paid  Premiums paid 
The obligation does not cease for pension systems where a 
defined benefit pension has been contractually agreed, until the 
agreed pensions have been paid out  Boliden commissions inde-
pendent actuaries to calculate pension obligations relating to the 
defined benefit pension plan arrangements in each country  For 
information on calculation parameters, see Note 2, Estimates and 
Revaluations of the defined benefit net pension liability, such 
as actuarial gains and or losses and the difference between 
the return on plan assets and the discount rate, are reported 
under Other comprehensive income including attributable 
special payroll tax  The financing cost of the net pension liabil-
ity is calculated using the discount rate for the pension liability  
and any previous periods, losses from settlements and costs in 
connection with special payroll tax are all reported in the Income 
Statement  Special payroll tax is regarded as part of the total net 
Boliden has established pension plans in the countries in which 
the company operates  The pension plans include both defined 
benefit and defined contribution plans  The defined benefit plans 
provide the employee with a fixed amount of their final salary in 
conjunction with retirement  Boliden’s defined benefit pension 
plans are mainly operated in Sweden and Ireland, and to a small 
comply with local regulations in the respective countries  Boliden 
has defined contribution plans in Sweden, Ireland, Finland and 
Boliden’s pension obligations in Sweden are not invested in funds  
The pension obligations are secured through the Swedish PRI/
FPG system and through insurance companies  The majority of the 
pension commitments for salaried employees are secured through 
insurance with Alecta and are lifelong retirement pensions  The 
benefits offered by the lifelong pensions are determined using 
different percentages for different salary intervals  Alecta has 
not provided sufficient information for the 2023 financial year 
for the ITP plan to be reported as a defined benefit plan, thus it is 
reported as a defined contribution plan under UFR 10, Reporting 
of ITP 2 pension plan financed through insurance with Alecta  A 
surplus in Alecta can be allocated to the policyholders and or 
those insured  At the end of the year, Alecta’s collective consolida-
tion level was 158 percent (172)  The collective consolidation level 
comprises the market value of Alecta’s assets as a percentage of 
the insurance commitments calculated in accordance with Alecta’s 
actuarial calculation assumptions, which do not correspond with 
those of IAS 19  Boliden’s pension obligations account for only a 
very small percentage of Alecta’s insurance commitments  There 
are, in addition to the ITP plans, a few previously earned tempo-
“Gruvplanen” (GP) is a pension agreement for underground 
workers  The plan grants underground workers entitlement to 
receive a pension between the ages of 60 and 65 and between 
65 and 70 under certain preconditions based on an average 
income  The “Gruvplanen” plan was closed to new earners in 2011 
and replaced by a defined contribution pension plan (GLP)  The 
commitments change from vesting to non-vesting in conjunction 
The pension commitment is secured by the transfer of funds to 
four defined benefit plans and one defined contribution plan  The 
defined benefit plans are closed to new employees  The pension 
plans are governed by the Irish Pensions Board and Irish Pensions 
Legislation  All of the defined benefit pension plans are funded  
The largest defined benefit plan and the defined contribution 
pension plan both have Board Members from the company and 
the members  Boliden has appointed the Irish Pension Trust to 
The financial position of the pension plans is reviewed every three 
years by an actuary in order to determine the requisite financing 
level  The actuary ensures that Boliden receives annual reports on 
the financial position in accordance with accounting requirements  
Payments are made to all five plans through a combination of con-
tributions from both Boliden and employees in accordance with 
The Board of the pension plans is responsible for investments in 
plan assets  A significant proportion of plan assets are placed in 
European government bonds to reduce the risk  Cash and cash 
equivalents are held in order to facilitate pension disbursements 
The current value of Boliden’s pension commitment is slightly 
higher than last year’s level, largely due to the effect of amended 
The Group’s reported pension liability was SEK 1,128 m (953)  The

Sensitivity analysis of the effect on the defined benefit pension liability (+increase/−decrease in pension liability)
The sensitivity analysis has been conducted on the basis of the 
above actuarial changes, as Boliden is of the opinion that they can 
have a substantial impact on the pension liability  It is also likely 
that changes to these assumptions will be made  The calculations 
have been performed by means of the analysis of each change 
individually, and the calculations have not taken into account any 
interdependence between the assumptions  No sensitivity analy-
ses have been conducted for Norway and Finland as the amounts 
in question are insignificant  Other countries have no defined 
Benefits scheduled for disbursement within 12 months
Benefits scheduled for disbursement within 1−5 years
Benefits scheduled for disbursement after 5 years or more
The maturity of plan assets in Ireland has reduced anticipated payments after five years or more  The weighted average duration of the 
defined benefit pension liability is 17 years for Sweden and 10 years for Ireland 
Provisions are reported when the Group has, or may be consid-
ered to have, an obligation as a result of events that have occurred 
and it is likely that disbursements will be required in order to fulfill 
this obligation  A further prerequisite is that it should be possible 
to make a reliable estimate of the amount to be disbursed 
When a significant effect arises due to the point in time at which 
a provision is made, the provision is valued at the present value of 
the amount expected to be required to settle the obligation  Here, 
a discount interest rate is used before tax that reflects current 
market evaluations of the time value of money in the long term 
and the risks associated with the provision  The increase due to the 
passing of time is reported as an interest expense  Provisions are 
With the exception of pensions (see Note 24), Boliden’s provisions 
refer primarily to reclamation costs that are expected to arise 
when an operation is decommissioned  Provisions are also made 
for any purchases of emission rights and for any remuneration 
payable in conjunction with the termination of employment 
that may be payable to employees to whom a commitment of 
termination has been given or to employees who accept volun-
tary redundancy  The Group reports a provision and a cost in 
conjunction with a termination when Boliden is obligated either 
to give the employee notice prior to the normal point in time for 
employment’s cessation, or to provide remuneration with a view 
Provisions for reclamation costs are made on the basis of an 
assessment of future costs based on current technology and other 
conditions  The present value of assessed reclamation liabilities are 
reserved in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabili-
ties and IFRIC 1 Changes in existing decommissioning, restoration 
and similar liabilities  We strive to achieve gradual reclamation, but 
most reclamation work takes place following a decision to decom-
mission  In historical terms, Boliden has succeeded in extending 
the useful life of its mining assets compared with the original 
plans  Provisions for reclamation are reviewed on an ongoing 
basis  Additions to existing provisions relate mainly to Aitik and 
Garpenberg  Aitik’s reclamation reserve is expanded to be based 
on the entire life of the mine, 2047  This will be included in the the 
new operating permit application  Garpenberg has made certain 
technical adjustments to the reclamation plan for the tailings facil-
ity, which affects the size of the reclamation reserve 
To determine the size of the reclamation liability, a discount 
interest rate of 2 5 percent (2 5) was used  A sensitivity analysis in 
respect of the discount rate is presented in Note 2, Estimates and 
The following financial instruments, i e  financial assets and liabili-
ties, are recognized in the Balance Sheet: shares, receivables, cash 
Financial instruments are recognized in the Balance Sheet when 
the company becomes bound by the instrument’s contractual 
terms (the economic approach)  However, liabilities to credit insti-
tutions are not reported until the settlement date  Financial assets 
are removed from the Balance Sheet when the rights entailed by 
the agreement are utilized, matured or are transferred to another 
counterparty  Financial liabilities are removed from the Balance

When presenting the fair value of liabilities to credit institutions, 
the fair value is calculated as discounted agreed amortizations 
and interest payments at estimated market interest margins  The 
fair value of trade receivables and trade and other payables is 
deemed to be the same as the reported value due to the short 
term to maturity, to the fact that provisions are made for expected 
credit losses, and to the fact that any penalty interest incurred will 
be debited  The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is deemed 
to be the same as the reported value, since the expected credit 
losses are insignificant  The general credit rating of the banks has 
been applied in order to calculate credit losses which have been 
If changes in value cannot be determined for financial assets or 
liabilities reported at fair value, they are reported at the historical 
costs of the instruments at the time of acquisition, which corre-
sponds to the fair value at the time of acquisition  
Boliden provides information on all financial assets and liabilities 
reported at fair value in the Balance Sheet on the basis of a three-
level fair value hierarchy  Level 1 comprises instruments that are 
listed and traded on an active market where identical instruments 
are traded  Level 2 comprises instruments that are not traded on 
an active market, but where observable market data is used for 
valuation of the instrument (either directly or indirectly)  Level 3 
comprises instruments where the valuation is, to a considerable 
The assessments have been conducted on the basis of the circum-
stances and factors that apply with regard to the various instru-
ments  Metal futures are classified as level 2, in that the discounted 
prices are based on listed daily prices from the stock exchanges  
Currency futures and interest rate swaps have also been classified 
as level 2, with reference to the fact that the valuation is based 
on observable market data  The fair value of liabilities to credit 
institutions has been classified as level 2, as these are calculated as 
discounted agreed amortizations and interest payments at esti-
mated market interest rate levels  The fair value therefore essen-
tially corresponds to the reported value  Shares and participations 
that are not listed have been classified as level 3  Exceptions to 
classification on the basis of the fair value hierarchy are made for 
trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade and other 
payables where the reported value is deemed to constitute a 
Amortized cost is calculated using the effective interest rate 
method  This means that any premiums or discounts, as well as 
expenses or income directly attributable to them, are distributed 
over the duration of the contract using calculated effective interest 
rate  The effective interest rate yields the instrument’s historical 
cost as a result in conjunction with current value calculation of 
The financial assets in this category include financial investments, 
cash and cash equivalents, and receivables not listed on an active 
market  These financial instruments are characterized by being 
part of a business model whose purpose is to be held until matu-
rity and to collect cash flows from payments of principals and any 
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial instruments in the category fair value through profit or 
loss are characterized by being part of a business model whose 
purpose is to be held until maturity or held for sale, and which are 
expected to be sold in a near future  Financial assets in this cate-
gory are valued at fair value and changes in value are reported in 
Financial assets and liabilities by valuation category
Boliden’s financial instrument holdings, which are reported at fair value in the Balance Sheet are all classified as level 2 items in the fair 
hierarchy, with the exception of a minor amount of level 3 holdings in other shares and participations  
Financial derivative instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives valued at fair value, and for which changes in value are 
reported in net financial items, consist of currency futures and are 
Derivatives used in hedge accounting comprise derivatives valued 
at fair value included in fair value hedging or cash flow hedging  
The derivatives comprise metal futures, currency futures and 
interest rate derivatives  The hedge relationship is identified 
and documented  For Boliden’s risk management policies and 
strategy objectives for the hedge, see also, “Risk management” 
in the Directors’ Report on pages 53–57  An assessment of hedge 
efficency is documented both when hedging commences and on 
an ongoing basis  Efficacy is assessed by means of an analysis of 
the economic correlation between the hedged item and hedging 
instrument, and by ensuring that the effect of the credit risk does 
not dominate changes in value of underlying items and instru-
ments  The hedge ratio for the hedge relationship is the same as in 
Changes in value of financial derivatives used to hedge a binding 
undertaking are reported under the operating profit together 
with changes in value of the asset or liability that the hedging 
is designed to counter  Parts of inventories constitute binding 
undertakings and are reported at market value as inventory value  
Changes in value of derivatives consequently effectively match the 
changes in value from hedged items in the Income Statement and 
Hedge accounting is applied to financial derivatives that refer to 
the hedging of forecast flows  This means that the effective part of 
the unrealized market values is reported as other comprehensive 
income up to the point in time when the hedged item, such as fore-
cast metal sales, US dollar income and interest expenses, is realized 
and thus reported in the Income Statement  Realized gains/losses 
attributable to metal and currency derivatives are reported in net 
sales, while the gains/losses on interest rate derivatives are reported 
in net financial items  If the hedge refers to a non-financial item such 
as major investments concluded in foreign currency, the capitalized 
earnings from equity is transferred to the asset’s ­
then booked in the Income Statement in line with depreciations  
Any ineffective part of cash flow hedging is reported as operating 
Hedge accounting in respect of net investments in overseas oper-
ations is reported as other comprehensive income  Any ineffective

Financial liabilities primarily consist of liabilities to credit insti-
tutions and trade and other payables  The anticipated term of 
trade and other payables is short, and the value is consequently 
reported at a nominal amount in accordance with the amortized 
cost method as the amount is considered to correspond to the 
value  Liabilities to credit institutions are initially valued at amounts 
received, less any arrangement fees, and are then valued at amor-
tized cost  Interest expenses are reported on an ongoing basis in 
the Income Statement with the exception of the part included in 
the historical cost for property, plant and equipment  Capitalized 
arrangement fees are reported directly against the loan liability 
to the extent that the loan agreement’s underlying loan guaran-
tee has been utilized, and are allocated over time in the Income 
Statement as other financial expenses over the contractual term of 
the loan  If a loan agreement is terminated or otherwise ceases to 
apply at a point in time prior to the end of the original contractual 
term, capitalized arrangement fees are recognized as an expense  
If a current agreement is renegotiated during the contractual 
term, any additional fees in connection with the renegotiation are 
allocated over the remaining contractual term of the loan

Disputes arising from the dam accident in Spain in the late 1990s
In April 1998, a dam accident occurred at the Los Frailes mine in 
Spain, which was then owned by Boliden’s subsidiary, Boliden 
Apirsa S L  (”Apirsa”)  Investigations concluded that the accident 
had been caused by design and construction errors in the dam, 
Nevertheless, the Spanish Ministry of the Environment issued a 
fine of approximately EUR 45 m towards Apirsa  In addition, the 
local government (Junta de Andalucia) directed a claim against 
Apirsa, Boliden BV and Boliden AB for alleged clean-up costs in 
connection with the accident  This claim, amounting to close to 
EUR 90 m, was tried by the First Instance Court no  11 of Seville  
In its judgement issued in July 2023, the Court fully dismissed the 
Junta’s claim and imposed the legal costs for the proceedings on 
the Junta  The decision has been appealed by the Junta to the next

Disputes regarding Boliden Kevitsa Oy’s tax reassessment for 
The Finnish Tax Authorities reassessed Boliden Kevitsa Oy’s 
taxation for the years 2012 to 2016, which resulted in increased 
tax expenses of EUR 34 m (including interest and penalties)  The 
reassessment was attributable to reorganizations prior to Boliden’s 
acquisition of Kevitsa from First Quantum Minerals (FQM)  
Boliden has paid in all relevant amounts to the Finnish tax author-

fulfilled its indemnification obligation by transferring the disputed 
amounts, in total EUR 36 7 m (including capital amount and inter-

REPORT ON THE ANNUAL ACCOUNTS AND CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
of Boliden AB (publ) for the financial year 2023-01-01 – 2023-12-31, except for the corporate governance statement on 
pages 66-77 and the statutory sustainability report on pages 8–11,

2023 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year 
then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts

report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit 
committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those standards 
are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section  We 
are independent of the parent company and the group in accor-
dance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have 
otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements  This includes that, based on the best of our

The group has commitments for reclamation of closed mines and 
for reclamation costs that are expected to arise for mines when 
the mine operations are decommissioned  The provision for these 
commitments is judgmental and dependent on several factors 
including cost estimates for different reclamation measures, life 
of mine, regulatory decisions, and discount rates  Any changes in 
these estimates and assumptions may have a significant impact on 
The group’s accounting principles for reclamation provisions, this 
year’s change in capitalized reclamation costs, and the group’s 
reclamation provisions are described in note 2, 14 and 25

The group is exposed to changes in metal prices, exchange rates 
and interest rates  To reduce its exposure in larger investment 
projects and in contracted purchase and sales commitments the 
group uses various types of financial instruments, including deriv-
atives  The group also manages its exposure to changes in interest

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions  Reasonable 
assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee 
that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a 
material misstatement when it exists  Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or 
in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence

the audit  We also: −Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts, whether due to 
fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures respon-
sive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions  The risk of 
not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is 
higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve 
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, 
or the override of internal control  Obtain an understanding of 
the company’s internal control relevant to our audit in order

evidence obtained, as to whether any material uncertainty exists 
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt 
on the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a going

required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related 
disclosures in the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion 
about the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  Our 
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the 
date of our auditor’s report  However, future events or condi-

a going concern  −Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the

From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we 
determine those matters that were of most significance in the 
audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including 
the most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and 
are therefore the key audit matters  We describe these matters in 
the auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure 
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appro-

among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and 
the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s 
organization is designed so that the accounting, management of 
assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled 
in a reassuring manner  The Managing Director shall manage 
the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors’ 
guidelines and instructions and among other matters take 
measures that are necessary to fulfill the company’s accounting 
in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a 
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and 
thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain 
audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance 
whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing 
Director in any material respect: −has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which 
can give rise to liability to the company, or −in any other way has acted in contravention of the ­
Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association 
Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropri-
ations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion 
about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance 
whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions 
or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that

As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and 
maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit  The exam-
ination of the administration and the proposed appropriations of 
the company’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the 
accounts  Additional audit procedures performed are based on 
our professional judgment with starting point in risk and materi-
ality  This means that we focus the examination on such actions, 
areas and relationships that are material for the operations and 
where deviations and violations would have particular impor-
tance for the company’s situation  We examine and test decisions 
undertaken, support for decisions, actions taken and other cir-
cumstances that are relevant to our opinion concerning discharge 
from liability  As a basis for our opinion on the Board of Directors’ 
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss we exam-

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are respon-
sible for the preparation of the Esef report in accordance with 
the Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market

RevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve 
reasonable assurance that the Esef report is prepared in a format 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a 
guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 
and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always

The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 
1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
The examination involves obtaining evidence, through various 
procedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format 
that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts  The procedures selected depend on 
the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of 
material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error  
In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design audit 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor 
considers those elements of internal control that are relevant to 
the preparation of the Esef report by the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  The exam-
ination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and 
reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors 
The procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report 
has been prepared in a valid XHMTL format and a reconciliation of 
the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated 
Furthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of 
whether the consolidated statement of financial performance, 
financial position, changes in equity, cash flow and disclosures in 
the Esef report have been marked with iXBRL in accordance with

As part of Boliden’s strategy, and to further integrate our sustain-
ability commitments with Boliden’s financing activities, a Green 
Finance Framework was established in May 2022 which will enable 
Boliden to issue Green Bonds and Green Loans  The Green Finance 
Framework provides investors transparency on how they are 
contributing to Boliden’s vision to be the most climate friendly and 
Financing under the framework is earmarked for projects and 
investments within energy efficiency, pollution prevention and 
control, research and development, and clean transportation  
Examples of important projects that could be financed under the 
framework include energy and heat recovery, process and mine 
electrification, water purification, waste reduction and extraction 
The framework has undergone an independent external review 
by CICERO Shades of Green, now part of S&P, who have classified 
the framework as “CICERO Medium green” with an “Excellent” 
governance score and assessed it to be in alignment with the 
International Capital Market Association Green Bond Principles 
and the Loan Market Association Green Loan Principles 
To ensure transparency and accountability around the selection 
of investments to be financed under the framework, Boliden has 
established a cross-departmental Sustainable Finance Committee 
(SFC), being responsible for the evaluation and selection process  
The SFC ensures that only such assets and projects that comply 
with the Green Project categories defined in the Framework are 
eligible to be financed  Examples of other eligibility criteria are 
satisfactory outcome of ESG risk evaluation and CO2 lock-in effect 
In addition to the Green Bonds that Boliden issued during 2022, 
new Green Bonds amounting to NOK 1 4 billion were issued 
during 2023  The financing supports the expansion investments 
in Boliden Odda with the aim of increasing zinc production with a 
low climate footprint  The bonds were issued under Boliden’s MTN 
program and are listed on Nasdaq’s Sustainable Bonds list (SEK) 
Examples of Green Projects financed under the framework 
Proceeds from the Green bonds issued in 2022 and 2023 are 
allocated to Boliden’s expansion of the world’s most climate 
effective zinc smelter in Odda, Norway  The expansion means that 
the production of zinc with world-leading climate performance 
will almost double  The increased production capacity, together 
with improved energy efficiency and a new long-term contract 
for the supply of fossil-free electricity, means a further reduc-
tion in the already low carbon dioxide intensity  The investment 
includes several new facilities at Boliden Odda, including a new 
roaster, a new sulphuric acid plant, expansion and modernization 
of the leaching and the purification plant, a new cellhouse and 
expansion of the foundry and quay infrastructure  The investment 
is planned for a total of EUR 850 million and scheduled for com-

IInvestments funded under Boliden’s Green Finance Framework 
intend to bring energy efficiency improvements with the aim of 
reducing energy consumption (in absolute or relative terms) by 
using best available technology and beyond in the targeted area, 
and or significantly reduce pollution to water and air, as well as the 
reduction, recycling, recovery and reuse of waste  An important 
selection criterion is also that investments be in line with Boliden’s 
roadmap to achieve the target of 42% reduction in CO2 emissions 
by 2030 and the long term goal of net zero carbon emissions in 
In relation to the issued Green Bonds allocated for the expansion 
of Boliden Odda, the investments are in line with Boliden’s CO2 
roadmap and are intended to increase production capacity of low

The EU Taxonomy is a classification system that helps companies 
and investors identify environmentally sustainable economic 
activities to make sustainable investment decisions  It aims to 
scale up investments in projects and activities that are necessary 
to reach the objectives of the European Green Deal – the plan 
to make the EU’s economy environmentally sustainable  The 
Taxonomy Regulation sets out six environmental objectives and 
four overarching conditions that an economic activity must meet 
in order to qualify as environmentally sustainable 
The EU Taxonomy does not set mandatory requirements on 
environmental performance for companies or for financial prod-
ucts  Investors are free to choose what to invest in  However, it is 
expected that over time, the EU Taxonomy will encourage a transi-
tion towards sustainability in order to achieve the EU’s climate and 
Through delegated acts EU sets performance criteria (so called 
“technical screening criteria”) for activities covered by the EU 
Taxonomy to determine, when an economic activity substantially 
contributes to one of the environmental objectives, while not 
doing significant harm to any of the other five objectives  
Boliden is required to disclose to what extent our activities are 
covered by the EU Taxonomy (i e , if they are Taxonomy-eligible) 
and comply with the criteria set in the Taxonomy delegated 
acts (i e , if they are Taxonomy-aligned) and disclose our related 
Since our mines and smelters are not yet included in the EU 
Taxonomy Regulation, only a small part of Boliden’s operations 
within logistics, real estate and water treatment are taxonomy- 
Boliden is aware of initiatives that have been taken to include 
non-ferrous mining and or smelting in the EU Taxonomy and to 
develop technical screening criteria to evaluate the sustainability 
of such activities  So far, none of these initiatives have resulted in 
legislation  Given the increasing recognition of the importance of 
sustainable metal production - both for the green transition and 
for EU’s strategic autonomy – it would be reasonable to expect 
mining and smelting to be included in the EU Taxonomy 
Relevant economic activities The analysis of which of Boliden’s economic activities are in scope 
of the EU Taxonomy was carried out on a company-by-com-
pany basis using the descriptions of taxonomy-eligible activities 
included in the regulation to identify eligible activities  
The proportion of Boliden’s economic activities that are taxono-
my-eligible in 2023 is shown in the tables on the following pages  
As Boliden’s core business is not eligible, no revenue has been 
identified to be eligible  Hence, the below activities have been 
identified as relevant for Boliden in 2023 from either a Capex 
or Opex perspective  Eligibility is based on primarily the climate 
The Capex and Opex reported represents the proportion of capital 
and operational expenditures associated with taxonomy-eligible 
economic activities or related to the acquisition of products or ser-
vices from taxonomy-eligible economic activities  When it comes 
to reporting of eligible investments, the focus has been to review 
the largest projects per site to assess taxonomy-eligibility  For all 
the Taxonomy-eligible activities Boliden has identified, none have

Boliden uses Wood Mackenzie’s cash margin metric to 
measure the cost position of our smelters in relation to 
other smelters globally  Cash margin is the difference 
between revenue and cash cost and is expressed in USc/
lb metal  The income comprises treatment and refining 
For zinc smelters, the sales of sulphuric acid is included in 
the revenue, while it is a credit in the cash cost calculation 
for copper smelters  The revenue from sales of surplus 
energy is calculated as a credit against cash cost 
The calculations for copper smelters are expressed as unit 
of metal produced from concentrate, while for zinc smelters 
it is expressed as unit of finished metal produced  Income 
is normally included if it is regarded as having been derived 
from the main process during the production of metal and 
Boliden uses the Wood Mackenzie’s cash cost metrics, C1 
Normal costing and C1 Pro rata costing, to measure the cost 
position of our mines in relation to other mines worldwide  
The lower a mine’s cash cost, the better its cost position  
Cash cost is expressed in USc/lb of metal and can be mul-
tiplied by 22 0462 (rounded) to obtain the price in USD per 
In normal costing calculations, the costs are allocated in 
their entirety to one main metal and then reduced by the 
net revenue1) of other metals, known as by-products 
In pro rata cash costing, the costs are divided between the 
various metals on the basis of the individual metal’s share of 
In composite costing, mines are included using either 
normal costing or pro rata costing on the basis of criteria 
based on the metals’ net revenue  If a metal accounts for 
65% or more of the total net revenue, the cash cost is calcu-
lated using normal costing  If not, the cash cost is calculated
