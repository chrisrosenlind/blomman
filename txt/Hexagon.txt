If we focus only on global pressures, we lose sight of companies

challenges  If I think about labour shortages, difficult market 
conditions and uneven global growth, then I also think about an

appetite for localised technology and expertise, and an urgent 
need for expert specialisation in automation and autonomy

The financial targets are to reach annual average sales 
adjusted operating margin including amortisation surplus 
values (EBIT1 incuding PPA) of over 30 per cent by 2026  
The margin target includes amortisation of surplus 
values (PPA)  The targeted sales growth is driven by a 
combination of 5–7 per cent organic growth per year and 
3–5 per cent structural growth per year from acquisitions  
The targets will be reached through a continued focus on 
innovation and customer-centric solutions to further sales 
Hexagon’s growth strategy is focused on using technology 
and innovative leadership to grow organically and through 
acquisitions, with a focus on customer-centric solutions  
Total average annual growth is estimated at 8–12 per cent, 
with variation expected between the years  Organic growth, 
which is estimated at 5–7 per cent annually, relates in 
part to GDP-driven growth from existing solutions, but is 
primarily expected to come from increasing revenues from 
new solutions  An increase in recurring revenue is expected 
through more focus on customer-centric solutions and an 
increase in revenue coming from software  Acquisition-
related growth is estimated at approximately 3–5 per cent 
Hexagon has proven its ability to steadily deliver enhanced 
margins  Since 2012, the adjusted operating margin (EBIT1) 
has increased by 9 percentage points  The ambitious 
adjusted operating margin of more than 30 per cent by 
2026 will continue to be strengthened by changes to the 
sales mix  where software and new product generations 
account for a greater share of sales  The target is that 
organic growth will contribute with an incremental margin 
of 35–40 per cent  At the same time, the cost structure 
will continue to change  Investments in R&D will continue 
in order to meet the demand of a more solution-centric 
business  This will trigger investments in sales resources 
while reducing administrative costs, which are non-
The target to improve profitability will be achieved 
through a higher proportion of sales from new high-margin 
applications and software, with a high recurring revenue 
percentage  There is also a strong focus on further 
generating and utilising synergies  The shift toward a higher 
proportion of software- and solution-selling has improved 
the operating margin but also resulted in changes to the 
cost structure  Hexagon now has lower costs for goods sold, 
During the second year of the new financial plan, organic 
net sales increased by 7 per cent, fuelled by strong demand 
for our solutions across regions and industries  Adjusted 
operating earnings excluding PPA (EBIT1) increased by 5 per 
cent to 1,596 7 MEUR, corresponding to a margin of 29 4 per 
cent  The EBIT1 including PPA margin was 27 2 per cent

The Annual Accounts Act and the Code stipulate that 
the Board of Directors must submit a report on the key 
aspects of the company’s systems for internal controls 
Internal control pertaining to financial reporting is a 
process that involves the Board, company management 
and other personnel  The process has been designed 
so that it provides assurance of the reliability of the 
external reporting  According to a generally accepted 
framework that has been established for this purpose, 
internal control is usually described from five different

Board and Executive Leadership  The organisation is 
characterised by well-defined allocation of responsibility 
and well-functioning and well-established governance 
and control systems, which apply to all Hexagon units  
The basis for the internal control pertaining to financial 
reporting is comprised of an overall control environment 
in which the organisation, decision-making routes, 
authorities and responsibilities have been documented 
Hexagon’s finance policy and reporting instructions 
and in accordance with the authorisation arrangements 
Hexagon’s functions for financial control are integrated 
by means of a group-wide reporting system  Hexagon’s 
financial control unit engages in close and well-functioning 
cooperation with the subsidiaries’ controllers in terms of 
the financial statements and the reporting process  The 
Board’s monitoring of the company’s assessment of its 
internal control includes contacts with the company’s 
auditor  Hexagon has no internal audit function, since 
the functions described above satisfy this need  All 
of Hexagon’s subsidiaries report complete financial 
statements on a monthly basis  This reporting provides the 
basis for Hexagon’s consolidated financial reporting  Each 
legal entity has a controller responsible for the financial 
control and for ensuring that the financial reports are 
correct, complete and delivered in time for consolidated 
The significant risks affecting the internal control of 
financial reporting are identified and managed at group, 
business area, subsidiary and unit level  Within the Board, 
the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that 
significant financial risks and the risk of error in financial 
reporting is identified and managed in a manner that 
ensures correct financial reporting  Special priority has 
been assigned to identifying processes that, to some 
extent, give rise to a higher risk of significant error due to 
the complexity of the process or of the contexts in which 
The risks identified with respect to the financial reporting 
process are managed via the company’s control activities  
The control activities are designed to prevent, uncover and 
correct errors and non-conformities  Their management 
is conducted by means of manual controls in the form of, 
for example, reconciliations, automatic controls using IT 
systems and general controls conducted in the underlying 
IT environment  Detailed analyses of financial results and 
evaluation in relation to budget and forecasts supplement 
the business-specific controls and provide general 
confirmation of the quality of the financial reporting 
To ensure the completeness and correctness of financial 
relevant and significant information is exchanged within 
the business, within the particular unit and to and from 
management and the Board  Guidelines, handbooks and 
job descriptions pertaining to the financial process are

internal control process from the Audit Committee  To 
ensure that the external communication of information 
is correct and complete, Hexagon complies with a Board 
approved information policy that stipulates what may be 
The efficiency of the process for risk assessment and 
the implementation of control activities are reviewed 
continuously  The follow-up pertains to both formal and 
informal procedures used by the officers responsible 
at each level  The procedures incorporate the review of 
financial results in relation to budget and plans, analyses 
and key figures  The Board obtains current and regular 
reports on Hexagon’s financial position and performance  
At each Board meeting, the company’s financial position is 
addressed and, on a monthly basis, management analyses

Sustainability considerations in the design process 
When developing new products, a robust design phase is 
critical to ensure that sustainability considerations are 
encompassing all products throughout their life cycles  
New solutions are leveraged through Hexagon’s Innovation 
Process (HIP), a process that drives the efficiency 
improvement  In addition to quality and cost management, 
ESG criteria were implemented in the process to increase 
to consider the environmental impact of the alternatives 
(LCAs) of targeted products, assessment of improvement 
potentials and assessment of these alternatives during 
product development  The LCAs include assessing the 
materials water usage, land usage and effects on climate 
change together with logistics, manufacturing, usage and 
end-of-life scenarios  The ambition is to also include data 
on the components from suppliers to understand the full 
cradle-to-gate environmental impact of each product 
to support decision-making and drive sales  To ensure 
that the HIP is properly leveraged across Hexagon, the 
company provided training to 42 of its key R&D engineers 
that are involved in the early-stage prototyping of 
hardware products  A dedicated employee is supporting 
the process to find environmental hotspots in hardware 
design and iterate improvement alternatives  As part of 
the Hexagon Innovation Process, each product group 
within Geosystems receives a recycling passport, which 
reviews materials used while it confirms that each product 
complies with the EU Directives on Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (WEEE 2012/19/EU) and Restriction 
of the use of certain hazardous substances (2011/65/EU)  
The recycling passport gives information on the product 
groups’ reusability, recyclability, treatment, and waste 
Ethical development of artificial intelligence (AI) 
technology that optimises and enriches data to prepare 
opportunities but also with risks  To ensure the AI-driven 
solutions generate value for customers and society at 
large and to avoid unexpected negative effects from the 
software development, Hexagon has defined four key 
principles that encompass its innovation and production 
of artificial intelligence software: 1  Technology augments what people do  it does not 
2  System data is owned by Hexagon's customers, adheres 
to local laws and respects citizens’ right to privacy 
3  Algorithms and output are transparent, explainable and 
4  Actionable results facilitate fair and inclusive 
As Hexagon’s innovation activities for artificial intelligence 
software adheres to the four principles, the company can 
certify that the use of its solutions will provide positive 
outcomes for its customers while also avoiding legal or 
A significant part of Hexagon’s business is software-
related, meaning that a large share of the company’s 
total carbon emissions is related to the operations of the 
cloud computing and storage at its providers and internal 
servers  To reduce its cloud waste, which refers to the 
unnecessary consumption of cloud resources leading 
to higher costs without providing significant benefits or 
value, Hexagon initiated a project with one of its major 
cloud providers during 2023  The purpose is to map and 
decrease its unnecessary emissions through purchasing 
server capacity hosted with green energy and to more 
efficiently utilise the available server computing and 
storage resources  Preliminary results from 2023 indicate 
a decrease of 40 5 metric CO2eq tonnes, of which 38 2 
metric CO2eq tonnes was saved due to renewable energy 
cloud efficiences compared to on-premises equivalent 
workloads  Since its implementation, Hexagon tracks its 
related cloud emissions on a monthly basis The final effects 
and outcomes of the project will be presented in 2024  
The safety of personnel in the workplace is a top priority 
for Hexagon  Ensuring that employees work in a safe and 
healthy environment is the key to any successful business  
Hexagon aims to provide a workplace that is free of 
incidents and promotes a culture of hazard identification 
and awareness, near-misses and incident reporting and 
self accountability  Where appropriate, Hexagon supports 
a flexible workplace and the opportunity to work from 
home  Hexagon is responsible for maintaining a safe work 
environment by implementing all applicable health and 
safety rules and practices within each Hexagon entity  
Employees are provided with appropriate training and 
safety equipment to perform their jobs securely  Each 
employee is personally responsible for working in a safe 
manner, following all health and safety policies and 
procedures, participating in safety training and identifying 
and reporting any health and safety issues and hazards 
to management or the relevant internal stakeholders  In

assessment of the overall competitiveness of the offering 
and if they live up to the goals and values expressed in 
the United Nations Global Compact’s ten principles in 
the areas of human rights, labour rights, environmental 
impact and anti-corruption  Compliance with the Supplier 
Code of Conduct, or other agreed equivalent standard, 
is a mandatory qualifying condition for Hexagon to enter 
a business relationship with a supplier  In addition, third-
party suppliers and subcontractors in Hexagon’s global 
supply chain are contractually required to meet these 
obligations  The Hexagon policies related to supply chain 
management include requirements for: 1  screening Hexagon suppliers against applicable

In 2023, Hexagon successfully reached its target of 
conducting sustainability supplier audits on 100% of its 
key suppliers in risk areas  The purpose of the supplier 
audit target was to ensure that the suppliers live up to the 
expectation on environmental stewardship of Hexagon 
and to prevent any forced labor, child labour or human 
trafficking within the value chain  During the year, Hexagon 
performed approximately 116 audits of new and existing 
suppliers, of which 45 audits were of suppliers in risk 
areas  Risk areas were considered as areas defined by 
Initiative (UNEPFI) and Transparency International which 
consider both environmental and social risks  The total 
number of suppliers in risk areas are 93, and all have been 
audited in the past three years  During 2023, 3 major non-
conformances were found in the audits, none of which 
violated any local or international laws but where corrective 
conformances cases were cases of suppliers who did not 
perform supplier due diligence in their own supply chain  All 
open non-conformances are expected to be solved in 2024  
When existing suppliers fail to comply with Hexagon’s 
supplier and conducts an impact assessment to understand 
the root cause  Appropriate follow-up actions consist of 
taking suitable actions to ensure that the issue will not be 
repeated  Should infringements be deemed significant 
and intentional, Hexagon will terminate the supplier 
contract and seek a sourcing alternative  Key suppliers 
of manufacturing entities are evaluated through internal 
formal visits, reviews and evaluations to ensure that they 
strictly follow the Hexagon Supplier Code of Conduct  Third 
party assessment is used in cases where an issue cannot be 
verified directly with the supplier  In 2023, 39 ESG supplier 
audits were conducted on-site, 73 were conducted through 
self-assessment questionnaires, and 4 were conducted 
A small part of Hexagon’s activities is affected by the 
regulation of conflict minerals including the Dodd Frank 
Act  Hexagon does not source conflict minerals directly, 
but some divisions are indirectly affected by regulations 
due to sourcing products and materials from suppliers 
and sub-suppliers  In such cases Hexagon works in close 
collaboration with the suppliers and apply a rigorous 
process to collect all necessary data as proof of compliance  
Hexagon maintains a Conflict Minerals Policy outlining the 
commitment and actions taken to avoid conflict minerals in 
its value chain  Hexagon’s divisions implement processes 
to ensure compliance with this policy as is applicable to 
each division’s operations  For example, the Autonomy & 
Positioning division requests current and new suppliers to 
complete a Conflict Mineral Report Template (CMRT) for all 
parts  The CMRT has been provided by Responsible Minerals 
Initiative (RMI) and has been adopted by the industry  The 
CMRT file is constantly being revised by RMI with updated 
Smelter information and whenever a supplier response 
is received the file automatically identifies suspected 
Smelters  Hexagon, to best of its knowledge, represents 
and certifies that it does not source or receive any minerals, 
materials or products containing cassiterite (tin), coltan 
(tantalum), wolframite (tungsten) or gold (known as “3TG 
minerals”) at all sourced from the Democratic Republic of

Basis of reporting for the Parent Company and the Group
The functional currency of the Parent Company is EUR as is the 
presentation currency for the Parent Company and the Group  
The financial reports are presented in EUR  All amounts, unless 
indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest million with 
Assets and liabilities are reported at historical cost except for 
certain financial instruments which are reported at fair value 
Receivables and liabilities or income and expenses are only off-
set if required or explicitly permitted by an accounting standard  
Preparing the financial statements in compliance with IFRS 
requires that Management make judgements and estimates as 
well as make assumptions that affect the application of account-
ing principles and the amounts recognised as assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses  The actual outcome may diverge from 
these estimates and assumptions  Estimates and assumptions 
are reviewed continuously  Changes of estimates are recognised 
in the period when the change is made if the change only affects 
current period or in that period when the change is made and 
coming periods if the change affects both current period and 
Judgements made by Management for the application of IFRS 
that have a substantial impact on the financial reports and esti-
mates made that may lead to significant adjustments in coming 
years’ financial reports are described in more detail in Note 2  
Fixed assets and long-term liabilities essentially consist of 
amounts expected to be realised or settled after twelve months 
from the balance sheet date  Current assets and short-term

Companies or businesses acquired (acquisitions) are accounted 
for under the purchase method  The method involves a business 
combination to be regarded as a transaction in which the Group indi-
rectly acquires the assets of the business and assumes its liabilities  
The Group’s acquisition cost is determined through a purchase price 
allocation in connection with the acquisition  The acquisition cost 
is the sum of the fair value at the acquisition date of what is paid in 
Contingent considerations are often conditional by future goals 
on sales or performance  At acquisition date, an estimation of the 
fulfilment of the goals is made  The contingent consideration is 
measured at fair value and included in the acquisition cost and 
recognised as a financial liability in accordance with IFRS  Long-
term contingent considerations are discounted to present value  
The measurement to fair value is initially based on the expected 
outcome of the acquired company’s sales or performance  Contin-
gent considerations are subsequently measured at fair value and 
essential effects of remeasurements are recognised in the income 
statement in accordance with IFRS  If a revenue is recognised as 
a consequence of a change in estimation, the surplus values from 
the acquisition will be tested for impairment  If the impairment test 
results in an impairment, the expense will meet the revenue from 
the remeasurement of the contingent consideration  Transaction 
costs are expensed in the income statement when incurred 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are rec-
ognised initially at their fair values at the acquisition date  Excep-
tions are made for acquired tax assets and liabilities, employee 
benefits, stock-based compensation and assets held for sale, 
valued in accordance with the principles described for each item

Assets and liabilities in operations with a functional currency 
other than EUR are translated at the closing day exchange rate 
and income statements are translated at average exchange 
rates for the period  The resulting translation differences are

The critical accounting estimates and assumptions that are 
addressed in this section are those that Company Management 
and the Board of Directors regard as the most important for 
understanding Hexagon’s financial reporting  The information 
is limited to areas that are significant considering the degree 
of impact and underlying uncertainty  Hexagon’s accounting 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience 
and assumptions that company management and the Board of 
Directors regard as reasonable under the current circumstances  
The conclusions based on these accounting estimates constitute 
the foundation for the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, 
in the event that they cannot be established through information 
from other sources  The actual outcome may differ from these 
Parts of Hexagon’s sales derive from major and complex cus-
tomer contracts  The critical estimates of customer contracts 
include establishing the amounts that are to be recognised as 
income and when the income should be recognised  For example, 
company management makes estimates of completed perfor-
mance in relation to the contractual terms and conditions, the 
estimated total contractual costs and the proportion of the 
contract that has been completed at a certain point in time  The 
degree of completion is established by setting incurred cost in 
relation to total costs required to complete the contract  The 
estimations are also base for any loss provision, if any 
Hexagon also enters into revenue agreements that contain mul-
tiple elements, such as hardware, software and or services  For 
these agreements, Hexagon need to assess if revenue should 
be allocated to each element as different accounting principles 
Intangible assets within Hexagon concern essentially pertain to 
goodwill, trademarks and other assets as a result of acquisition, 
such as customer relationships and technology  Goodwill and 
other acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life are not 
subject to annual amortisation, while other intangible assets 
are amortised  Insofar as the underlying operations develop 
negatively, an impairment requirement may arise  Impairment 
test is implemented if necessary, but at least once a year  Such 
intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing, 
which is essentially based on the value in use, making assump-
tions about the sales trend, the Group’s profit margins, on-going 
investments, changes in working capital and discount interest 
rate  Company management considers the assumptions applied 
to be compatible with the data received from external sources of 
information or from previous experience  Hexagon’s goodwill on 
31 December amounted to 9,616 6 MEUR (9,599 5)  Other intan-
gible assets not subject to amortisation amount to 1,073 9MEUR 
(1,060 4) as of this date  Performed impairment tests demon-
The Board of Directors and Company Management continuously 
assess the carrying amount of both current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities  For deferred tax assets, Hexagon has to 
assess the probability of whether it will be possible to utilise the 
deductible temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax 
assets to offset future taxable profits  In addition, in certain sit-
uations, the value of the deferred tax assets and liabilities may 
be uncertain due to ongoing tax processes, for example  Accord-
ingly, the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may deviate 
from these estimates due to a change in future earning capacity, 
changed tax regulations or the outcome of examinations by 
authorities or tax courts of issued or not yet issued tax returns  
When assessing the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
Hexagon has to form an opinion of the tax rate that will apply at 
the time of the reversal of the temporary differences  Hexagon 
recognised deferred tax liabilities, net in an amount of 400 7 
MEUR (459 5) net, at the end of 2023  At the same date, the Group 
had tax-loss carry-forwards with a value of 42 6 MEUR (49 7) that 
were not recognised as assets  These assets could not be cap-
italised based on assessments of the opportunity to utilise the 
tax deficits  In comparison with the final outcome, the estimates 
made concerning both deferred tax assets and liabilities could 
have either a positive or a negative impact on earnings 
Within Hexagon, there are defined-benefit pension schemes 
based on significant assumptions concerning future benefits 
pertaining to either the current or prior workforce  Pension obli-
gations amounted to 52 7 MEUR (48 2) at the end of 2023  When 
calculating the pension liability, a number of actuarial assump-
tions are of major significance to the outcome of the calculation  
The most critical pertain to the discount interest rate on the 
obligation, the rate of pay increases, employee turnover and esti-
mated length of life  A reduced discount interest rate increases 
the recognised pension liability  The actual outcome could devi-
ate from the recognised amount if the applied assumptions prove 
Hexagon acquire companies on a continuous basis  In connection 
with the acquisitions, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are 
valued to fair value in a purchase price allocation analysis  The 
valuation is to a certain extent based on management assess-
ment of the future earnings of the acquired company  Many of 
the acquisition deals contain contingent consideration which 
is based on the outcome of the acquired company earnings for 
a predetermined period  The fair value of contingent consider-
ations recognised as a liability is reviewed on a regular basis, 
which requires management to assess the future performance of 
the acquired company  An inaccurate assessment of this might 
result in overstated acquired assets or liabilities for contingent

• Discount rates • Growth rates used to extrapolate cash flow beyond the 
Projected cash flows, approved by management, is based on 
an analysis of historic performance as well as a best estimation 
regarding the future  Hexagon has since 2001 mainly shown rising 
operating margins and virtually continuous good organic growth  
The operating margins are based on average values achieved 
historically  The margins are increased over the period to reflect 
anticipated efficiency improvements  The organic growth is 
based on an analysis of how the competition situation is judged 
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the 
risks specific to respective CGU, taking into consideration the 
time value of money as well as individual risks  The discount rate 
calculation is based on the specific circumstances of respective 
CGU and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC)  The WACC considers both debt and equity  The cost of 
equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the

and management believe that no reasonably possible change in 
any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value 
to materially exceed the recoverable value  For all cash generat-
ing units except Asset Lifecycle Intelligence there is a significant 
headroom before any changes in key assumptions would cause 
a valuation adjustment, since the recoverable value totally is 
nearly double the book value  The performed sensitivity analysis 
demonstrates that the value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets with indefinite useful life is more than defendable even if 
the discount rate is increased with one percentage point or if the 
growth rate after the forecast period is decreased with one per-
centage point for all cash generating units except Asset Lifecycle 
Intelligence  For Asset Lifecycle Intelligence the recoverable 
amount would equal the carrying value if the discount rate would 
be increased by 0 6 percentage point or the terminal growth rate 
would be decreased by 0 5 percentage point  Even forecasts for 
sales growth and operating margin are included in the sensitivity 
analysis and no reasonable changes in these would cause a need

mated at 45 2 MEUR, of which employer’s contribution 25 7 
The following applies for the Swiss plans which represent 89 per cent 
of the total pension obligations  The Swiss plans include the following 
sub-plans: retirement pension (main plan), disability pension, manage-
ment plan, early retirement plan and jubilee plan  The main plan, retire-
ment pension, is financed through an individual savings account  The 
plan defines a retirement credit in per cent of insured salary depend-
ing on the age of the plan member and it guarantees an interest rate, 
which is annually determined by the Pension Fund  The minimum legal 
rate as fixed by the Swiss government has to be credited to the mini-
mum savings account  The interest is not allowed to negative, even if 
the actual return on assets is negative (capital protection)  The other 
kind of plans in Switzerland are of similar nature 
Shortfall in the schemes in Switzerland must be covered by the 
employer, while surpluses can only become due to the beneficia-
ries  The value of plan assets has been reduced accordingly 
Actuarial assumptions for the defined-benefit pension schemes 
For 89 per cent of the defined benefit obligation, the Swiss 
BVG 2020 tables have been used for the actuarial assumptions 
The table below describes the effect on the value of the defined 
benefit obligations of an isolated change in assumptions as

If the effect is material, the provision is determined by discount-
ing the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
the current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group 
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and 
the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly 
announced  No provision is posted for future operating losses 
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract 
Restructuring provisions primarily relates to a rationalisation 
programme that was introduced in the third quarter of 2023 and 
to transaction costs and cost in connection with the decision 
to freeze operations in Russia in the first quarter of 2022  The 
remaining part of restructuring provisions are mainly related to 
personnel and are expected to become due within 12 months 
Warranty provisions are estimated based on previous years 
statistical data and are evaluated on a regular basis  Since the 
warranty provisions are based on historical statistical data, the

Hexagon is a net borrower and has extensive international 
operations and is therefore exposed to various financial risks  
The Group Treasury Policy, approved by the Board, stipulates 
the rules and limitations for the management of the different 
financial risks within the Group  Hexagon’s treasury operations 
are centralised to the Group’s internal bank, which is in charge of 
coordinating the financial risk management  The internal bank is 
also responsible for the Group’s external borrowing and its inter-
nal financing  Centralisation entails substantial economies of 
scale, lower financing cost and better control and management 
of the Group’s financial risks  The internal bank has no mandate 
to conduct independent trading in currencies and interest rate 
instruments  All relevant exposures are monitored continuously 
and are reported to the Executive Leadership and the Board of 
Currency risk is the risk that exchange rate fluctuations will have an 
adverse effect on income statement, balance sheet and cash flow  
Furthermore, the comparability of Hexagon’s earnings between 
periods will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates  
Hexagon’s operations are mainly conducted internationally and 
sales, costs and net assets are therefore denominated in a number 
of currencies  As of 1 January 2011 the presentation currency is 
EUR for the Group  The change decreases the currency exposure 
in both the income statement and balance sheet as well as in other 
comprehensive income  It also allows the Hexagon Group to better 
match debt to net assets  Currency exposure originates both from 
transactions in non-domestic currencies in the individual oper-
ating entities, i e  transaction exposure and from translation of 
earnings and net assets into EUR upon consolidation of the Group, 
Sales and purchase of goods and services in currencies other 
than respective subsidiary’s functional currency give rise to 
transaction exposure  Transaction exposure is, as far as possible, 
concentrated to the countries where manufacturing entities are 
located  This is achieved by invoicing the sales entities in their 
In accordance with the Group Treasury Policy the transaction 
Translation exposure arises when the net assets are translated 
into EUR upon consolidation  Translation differences from net 
assets in other currencies than EUR reported in other compre-
hensive income during 2023 were -366 1 MEUR (435 4)  
The consolidated operating income and expense is mainly gener-
ated in subsidiaries outside the Euro-area  Changes in exchange 
rates therefore have a significant impact on the Group’s earnings 
when the income statements are translated into EUR  Transla-
tion exposure related to actual and forecasted earnings is not 
The interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will 
adversely affect the Group’s net interest expense and or cash 
flow negatively  Interest rate exposure arises primarily from the 
external interest bearing debt  In accordance with the Group 
Treasury Policy the average interest rate duration for the external 
debt should be in a range from 6 months to 3 years 
During 2023 interest rate derivatives were used in order to man-
Credit risk is the risk that counterparts may be unable to fulfil their 
payment obligations  Financial credit risk arises when investing 
cash and cash equivalents and when trading in financial instru-
ments  To reduce the Group’s financial credit risk, surplus cash 
is only invested with a limited number by the company approved 
banks and derivative transactions are only conducted with coun-
terparts where an ISDA netting agreement has been established 
As the Group is a net borrower, excess liquidity is primarily used 
to amortise external debt and therefore the average surplus cash 
Credit risk also includes the risk that customers will not pay 
receivables that the company has invoiced or intends to invoice  
Through a combination of geographical and business segmental 
diversification of the customers the risk for significant customer 
credit losses is reduced  An aging analysis of the receivables can 
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet the Group’s pay-
ment obligations in full as they fall due or can only do so at mate-
rially disadvantageous terms due to lack of cash resources  To 
minimise the liquidity risk, the Group Treasury Policy states that 
total liquidity reserves should at all times be at least 10 per cent

rency is translated to EUR using the exchange rate at year-end

Refinancing risk refers to the risk that Hexagon does not have 
sufficient financing available when needed to refinance maturing 
debt, due to existing lenders do not extend or Hexagon has difficul-
ties in procuring new lines of credit at a given point in time  Secur-
ing these requirements demands a strong financial position in the 
Group, combined with active measures to ensure access to credit  
In order to ensure that appropriate financing is in place and to 
decrease the refinancing risk, no more than 20 per cent of the 
Group’s gross debt, including unutilised credit facilities, is allowed 
to mature within the next 12 months without replacing facilities 
Following a refinancing in 2021, Hexagon’s main sources of 
1) A multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF) established during Q4 
2021  The RCF amounts to 1,500 MEUR with a tenor of 5+1+1 years 
2) A Swedish Medium Term Note Programme (MTN) established during 
Q2 2014  The MTN programme enables Hexagon to issue bonds up to 
a total amount of 20,000 MSEK  On 31 December 2023, Hexagon had 
issued bonds of a total amount of 11,650 MSEK (10,150) 
3) A Swedish Commercial Paper Programme (CP) established 
during 2012  The CP programme enables Hexagon to issue com-
mercial paper up to a total amount of 15,000 MSEK  Commercial 
paper with tenor up to 12 months can be issued under the pro-

The Group’s earnings are affected by changes in certain key factors, 
as described below  The calculations proceed from the conditions 
prevailing in 2023 and the effects are expressed on an annualised 
basis  Earnings in non-EUR subsidiaries are converted into EUR based 
on average exchange rates for the period when the earnings arise 
During the year there have been significant changes to the exchange 
rates of currencies that have the biggest impact on Hexagon’s 
earnings and net assets, CHF, CNY and USD  Compared to last year 
the EUR has weakened against CHF and strengthened against CNY 
and USD  Since Hexagon has a majority of the operating earnings 
denominated in CNY and USD, this had a negative impact on oper-
ating earnings  The strengthening of the CHF had a negative impact 
since a considerable part of the costs are denominated in CHF  An 
isolated strengthening in the exchange rate for EUR by 5 per cent for 
all assets and liabilities denominated in non-EUR currencies would 
have had an immaterial effect on net income but a negative effect 
on equity of 547 8 MEUR (535 3) net, and vice versa, after the impact 
During 2023, total operating earnings, excluding adjustments, from 
operations in other currencies than EUR amounted to an equivalent 
of 1,271 5 MEUR (1,232 7)  An isolated change in the exchange rate 
for EUR by 5 per cent against all other currencies would have a net 
effect on operating earnings of approximately 63 6 MEUR (61 6)  The average interest fixing period in the Group’s total loan portfolio 
as of year-end 2023 was less than one year  A simultaneous 1 per-
centage point change in interest rates in all of Hexagon’s funding 
currencies would entail a pre-tax impact of about 25 0 MEUR (25 5)

debt instruments are derecognised or impaired are recognised 
in profit or loss  Interest income is classified as financial income

We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial 
statements  In particular, we considered where management 
made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signif-
icant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions 
and considering future events that are inherently uncertain  As in 
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management over-
ride of internal controls, including among other matters consid-

Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain 
quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall 
group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a

Hexagon’s customer offerings contain solutions in which 
hardware and software are integrated as well as services and 
licenses  The critical management estimates of customer con-

as income and when the income should be recognised 
For integrated customer contracts management needs to assess 
if revenue should be allocated to each revenue type as different 
accounting principles apply for these revenue types  Manage-

Environmental data collection and reporting methodology
The data has been collected via Hexagon’s ESG reporting system, 
developed and aligned to the Financial reporting system during 
2023 for ESG data gathering and calculation purposes  
In 2023, environmental data was collected from all manufactur-
ing sites and all the facilities under our operational control with 
more than 35 FTEs  In order to cover the full scope of Hexagon’s 
operations, values have been extrapolated for energy consump-
tion, GHG emissions, water and waste  The extrapolation was 
performed on employees (FTEs) basis for sites not covered in the 
reporting system  The 2022 environmental data for energy con-
sumption, GHG emissions, water and waste has been restated to 
increase accuracy and year-over-year comparability 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from energy consumption are 
calculated using energy data in KWh by energy source (natural 
gas, diesel, electricity by country etc )  Scope 1 CO2 emissions are 
calculated using the emission factor for the corresponding type 
of fuel (source Defra 2023)  Scope 2 CO2 emissions are calculated 
with the location-based and the market-based methodology 
in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance  Loca-
tion-based emissions are calculated using average country/
region emission factor (source IEA and eGrid)  Market-based 
emissions are calculated using residual mix electricity emission 
factor for European counties (source AIB) and the USA (source 
Green-e) and average country emission factors for all other coun-
tries (source IEA)  To capture the CO2 emissions from energy con-
sumption for sites not covered (offices with low number of people 
in them), we estimated the Scope 1 and 2 by associating CO2 emis-
sions per employee and extrapolating to the number employees 
Scope 1 direct CO2 emissions include emissions from stationary
