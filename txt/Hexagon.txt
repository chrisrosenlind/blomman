Core
technologies
Reality capture
Digital capture of the physical 
world is the basic building block 
of a “digital reality” or twin  
This includes documenting and 
preserving an exact truth about 
what’s happened or happening; 
it means measuring and 
recording with perfect accuracy 
and precision; and it’s the ability 
to see, monitor, recognise and 
understand both contextually 
and dimensionally in 3D 
Positioning
The need for accurate position 
information is essential for 
tracking and controlling the 
movement or mobility of assets 
and people  Additionally, 
achieving full autonomy isn’t 
possible without positioning 
and other complementary 
technologies working together 
– finely-tuned and seamlessly – 
to make autonomy a reality  
Autonomous 
technologies
Enriching automated systems 
with sensors, artificial 
intelligence (AI) and analytical 
capabilities enables systems 
to function and execute tasks 
without human control  
Design and simulation 
Design and simulation 
technologies help solve real-
world problems safely and 
efficiently – enabling the digital 
creation and exploration of 
what could be  The ability to 
model and simulate millions of 
real-world scenarios means we 
can predict failure and success 
before they occur 
Location intelligence
Complete line of sight to 
dynamic situations – at any 
time and from any location 
– is indispensable to decision-
making for all mission-critical 
applications  The ability to 
instantly gain insight from 
complex data relationships 
leads to big-picture 
understanding and proactive 
problem-solving  
What matters most to compete in today’s world? Growth and profitability? Efficiency? Productivity? Quality? 
Safety? Digital transformation? What about sustainability?
Thanks to advances in digital reality technologies, achieving these priorities equally is no longer insurmountable 
Hexagon’s innovation strategy is built on its established leadership in each of the core technologies critical to 
realising the full potential of data

Letter from President and CEO
Shaping reality, 
responsibly
It is traditional to begin a letter of this kind by reflecting on 
the difficulties presented by macroeconomic headwinds; to 
show how despite geopolitical and economic challenges, the 
company emerged stronger than the previous year  I want to 
begin a little differently 
If we focus only on global pressures, we lose sight of companies 
and countries that are innovating every day to overcome 
challenges  If I think about labour shortages, difficult market 
conditions and uneven global growth, then I also think about an 
entire workforce passionate about decarbonisation, a growing 
appetite for localised technology and expertise, and an urgent 
need for expert specialisation in automation and autonomy  
Hexagon emerged from 2023 not in spite of global challenges, 
but rather because of them  When I speak to our customers, 
partners, and newly merged teams, I see market share leaders, 
capex drivers and industry champions  I see hundreds and 
hundreds of innovators  
Innovators who believe in Hexagon’s vision to shape a 
responsible future  These are organisations driven by the same 
spirit of innovation and progress that motivates us to push 
boundaries in autonomous technologies  They see obstacles 
as opportunities to create better solutions  They know that by 
working together, we can drive meaningful improvements in 
efficiency, safety, and sustainability 
At the core of our sustainability strategy, we believe in 
empowering industry through our solutions to accelerate 
change, coupled with our commitment to create change 
across our operations  Explore more in the sustainability 
section our Annual Report 
I am proud to lead a company that is not only a part of a 
growing appetite for change but also an enabler of it  
Better together 
Pursuing collaborations, partnerships, mergers and 
acquisitions with companies that make us think differently 
– better – has always been in Hexagon’s DNA  2023 was no 
different  
During HxGN LIVE 2023, we announced important 
collaborations with industry leaders NVIDIA and Sony 
Semiconductor Solutions  
With NVIDIA, we are connecting our technologies to 
empower real-time digital factory planning, optimisation, and 
operations through unified industrial metaverse workflows  
NVIDIA enriches our capabilities with deep learning expertise 
and advances our reality capture and analysis solutions 
Our partnership with Sony delivers a streamlined workflow 
from data capture to processing and analysis, reducing the 
time from scanning to results  By combining Sony’s Time-
of-Flight image sensor and software technologies with 
Hexagon’s reality capture capabilities, we are developing 
solutions that enable faster in-field feedback and more 
complete data capture 
Innovation at Hexagon doesn’t only mean developing 
the best technology for today, for one industry  It means 
developing the best of the best for tomorrow, for all  In July, 
we announced a world-first with Mineral Resources: a fully 
autonomous road train system controlled remotely by a

team of operators in Western Australia  As a step toward 
autonomous transportation, the delivery of advanced 
sensors and automation technologies exemplifies 
innovative safety and efficiency practices  Such pioneering 
methodologies can serve as models across various 
industries  
We grew our portfolio with six acquisitions in 2023  We’re 
pleased with the progress of integration, especially with the 
newly merged teams from Qognify, Projectmates, and HARD-
LINE  Each of the newly acquired companies aligns with our 
mission to reshape industries into safer, more efficient, and 
insight-driven environments  
Leading the charge 
In 2023, we launched over 400 products and filed almost 60 
new patent applications  More than 6,800 team members 
work in research and development or a related discipline 
worldwide, embedded in every division, nestled at the heart 
of the central innovation hub that serves the group  This 
approach places us directly in contact with our industries 
and helps us speak the language of our customers  The 
resulting products and patents are not only beacons of 
innovation but also serve to further the innovative potential 
of our customers  
At the beginning of the year we launched Nexus, a future-
ready digital reality platform purposely built for the discrete 
manufacturing ecosystem  Nexus allows our customers, for 
the first time, to exchange data in real time and accelerate 
innovative ways to make high-quality products more 
responsibly  Designed to complement existing systems 
rather than replace them, Nexus fosters collaboration 
and breaks down silos across departments, even whole 
organisations  With more than 30,000 users already, Nexus 
showcases the demand for open-platform computing 
At the Wichmann Innovation Awards in October, Hexagon 
was recognised in both the hardware and software 
categories for products that make reality capture more 
accessible  Reality Cloud Studio, powered by HxDR, 
provides an intuitive, automated platform accessible 
from any device to visualise and collaborate on digital 
twins  The BLK2GO PULSE, a handheld laser scanner born 
out of our collaboration with Sony, provides customers 
with cutting-edge first-person scanning controlled by 
a smartphone that delivers full-colour 3D point clouds 
instantly in the field  
The path forward 
Many statistics can describe a company – revenue, 
acquisitions, patents filed, products created – indeed, 
I’ve used some of these in this letter  There is one number 
which I think ties these metrics together: 150 petabytes  
Hexagon’s devices, in the hands of our customers or our 
employees, have created 150 petabytes of data in the last 
year alone  Positioning Hexagon as the world’s largest 
creator of 3D intelligence, as a leading force for change in 
some of the most crucial industries on the planet  Such 
a staggering amount of data means opportunity, means 
untapped potential for the future  
And yet for Hexagon, our focus extends beyond sensors 
and software; it fundamentally revolves around people  It’s 
the energy, skills, and aspiration to excel that continues to 
play a key role in our progress  Over the past two decades, 
we have built a dynamic and constantly evolving business 
through numerous acquisitions and integrations, driven by 
ambitious growth expectations  
Our path has been shaped and guided by a steadfast 
vision  It’s with this in mind we honour Melker Schörling, 
our primary shareholder and long-standing chairman, 
whose wisdom and foresight have been instrumental in 
the company’s evolution  He leaves behind an indelible 
legacy and sturdy foundation  As we strive to advance 
the mission that he inspired alongside my predecessor, 
Ola Rollén, we remain committed to their entrepreneurial 
spirit 
As we forge into 2024, with our dynamic and energised 
team, we step into a future of our making  Our 
entrepreneurial spirit – one that is transparent, market-
focused, and continually adapting – is infused throughout 
our organisation, across geographies, divisions, roles and 
functions  In nurturing this spirit and harnessing the power 
of data, we see a clear path to better serve our customers  
With our presence in field across industries, in core digital 
reality solutions, coupled with strong partnerships and 
skills around artificial intelligence, we are positioned to 
help customers leverage the full value of data to optimise 
productivity, efficiency, safety and quality  We envision 
a future where data is fully leveraged so that business, 
industry and humanity thrive responsibly  
In 2024, we stand on a steep curve of widespread 
technology innovation and a growing desire to capture 
and harness data effectively  But we are not there alone  
We stand alongside our customers and our collaborators 
– our community  Our mission guides us as we enable our 
customers to shape reality

The financial targets are to reach annual average sales 
growth of 8–12 per cent between 2022-2026 and an 
adjusted operating margin including amortisation surplus 
values (EBIT1 incuding PPA) of over 30 per cent by 2026  
The margin target includes amortisation of surplus 
values (PPA)  The targeted sales growth is driven by a 
combination of 5–7 per cent organic growth per year and 
3–5 per cent structural growth per year from acquisitions  
The targets will be reached through a continued focus on 
innovation and customer-centric solutions to further sales 
growth, margins and recurring revenues 
Continued growth 
Hexagon’s growth strategy is focused on using technology 
and innovative leadership to grow organically and through 
acquisitions, with a focus on customer-centric solutions  
Total average annual growth is estimated at 8–12 per cent, 
with variation expected between the years  Organic growth, 
which is estimated at 5–7 per cent annually, relates in 
part to GDP-driven growth from existing solutions, but is 
primarily expected to come from increasing revenues from 
new solutions  An increase in recurring revenue is expected 
through more focus on customer-centric solutions and an 
increase in revenue coming from software  Acquisition-
related growth is estimated at approximately 3–5 per cent 
annually 
Proven ability to deliver margin improvements
Hexagon has proven its ability to steadily deliver enhanced 
margins  Since 2012, the adjusted operating margin (EBIT1) 
has increased by 9 percentage points  The ambitious 
adjusted operating margin of more than 30 per cent by 
2026 will continue to be strengthened by changes to the 
sales mix  where software and new product generations 
account for a greater share of sales  The target is that 
organic growth will contribute with an incremental margin 
of 35–40 per cent  At the same time, the cost structure 
will continue to change  Investments in R&D will continue 
in order to meet the demand of a more solution-centric 
business  This will trigger investments in sales resources 
while reducing administrative costs, which are non-
accretive to profitability 
The target to improve profitability will be achieved 
through a higher proportion of sales from new high-margin 
applications and software, with a high recurring revenue 
percentage  There is also a strong focus on further 
generating and utilising synergies  The shift toward a higher 
proportion of software- and solution-selling has improved 
the operating margin but also resulted in changes to the 
cost structure  Hexagon now has lower costs for goods sold, 
but higher R&D and amortisation costs 
Development during 2023
During the second year of the new financial plan, organic 
net sales increased by 7 per cent, fuelled by strong demand 
for our solutions across regions and industries  Adjusted 
operating earnings excluding PPA (EBIT1) increased by 5 per 
cent to 1,596 7 MEUR, corresponding to a margin of 29 4 per 
cent  The EBIT1 including PPA margin was 27 2 per cent

Hexagon Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
Hexagon targets the efficient use of capital in order to generate a strong cash flow, reach 
a sound equity ratio and achieve a balanced debt structure while generating value for 
shareholders 
Other targets
Strong cash flow generation
A strong cash flow is necessary to finance investments, settle 
interest on debts and pay dividends to shareholders  Hexagon’s 
cash conversion, i e , the ratio at which profits are converted into 
cash, has averaged 84 per cent since 2013 and was 80 per cent 
(72) for 2023  
Hexagon’s target is to reach a cash conversion of 80–90 per 
cent  Cash flow from operating activities, excluding non-
recurring items, amounted to 1,451 9 MEUR (1,372 7) 
Efficient use of operating capital
Hexagon seeks to minimise working 
capital and in recent years, the 
ratio of working capital to sales has 
averaged less than 10 per cent  The 
ratio of working capital to sales in 2023 
amounted to 8 per cent (7)  
The downward trend of working 
capital as a percentage of sales 
results from a business model shift 
towards more software- centric 
solutions  Hexagon’s overall long-
term objective is to increase earnings per share by at least 15 
per cent annually and to achieve a return on capital employed 
exceeding 15 per cent over a business cycle, including goodwill 
from acquisitions  Return on average capital employed, excluding 
adjustments, was 11 4 per cent (11 5) in 2023 
Sound equity ratio and balanced debt structure
A sound equity ratio and balanced leverage are requirements for 
financing acquisitions by loans  Hexagon targets an equity ratio 
of at least 25 per cent and has the ambition to have a net debt to 
EBITDA ratio of 2 5x or below  The equity ratio amounted to 60 per 
cent (60) and the net debt to EBITDA ratio amounted to 1 7x (1 8) at 
year-end 2023  Debt capital markets account for 59 per cent (52) 
of Hexagon’s financing, while bank loans make up the remainder  
Hexagon’s net financial expense amounted to -155 3 MEUR 
(-38 7) in 2023  The average interest rate on the Group’s short- 
and long-term loans was 4 3 per cent (2 6) at year-end 2023 
Dividend policy
Hexagon’s dividend policy is to distribute 25–35 per cent of net 
earnings after tax  
The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of 0 13 EUR per 
share (0 12) for the fiscal year 2023, corresponding to 41 per 
cent of net earnings after tax 
Sustainability targets
Hexagon has a goal to reach 95% reduction of scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net-
zero by 2050  Hexagon succeeded in the target to conduct sustainability audits on 100 per 
cent of its direct suppliers in risk areas by 2023  Hexagon targets to achieve at least 30 per 
cent women in leading positions by 2025

Management of Hexagon’s capital
Hexagon’s reported shareholders’ equity, including non-
controlling interest, was 10,046 1 MEUR (9,864 6) at year-

earnings per share by at least 15 per cent annually and 
to achieve a return on capital employed of at least 15 per 
cent  Another Group objective is to achieve an equity 
ratio of 25 per cent as Hexagon is seeking to minimise 
the weighted average cost of capital for the company’s 
financing

regarding a key financial ratio (covenant) towards lenders  
The key financial ratio is reported to lenders in conjunction

and there is a risk of a temporary increase in borrowing 
costs  In addition, lenders have a right to terminate loan 
agreements  Hexagon has never breached any covenants, 
not in 2023 nor in prior years 
The company’s strategy, as well as its financial position 
and other financial objectives, are considered in 
connection with the annual decision concerning the 
dividend

Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines 
shall aim at promoting the company’s business strategy 
and long-term interests, including its sustainability  
The remuneration shall be on market terms and consist of 
fixed cash salary, variable remuneration, other benefits 
and pension  Additionally, the general meeting may – 
irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on, among other 
things, share-related or share price-related incentive 
programmes  The satisfaction of criteria for awarding 
variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a 
period of one year  The variable cash remuneration is 
capped and shall be maximised at up to 150 per cent of the 
fixed annual cash salary  
For senior executives, pension benefits shall be paid 
not earlier than from the age of 60 years  As a general

remuneration committee’s tasks include preparing the 
Board of Directors’ resolutions in remuneration-related 
matters  This includes any resolutions to derogate from

The proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior 
executives that were proposed and adopted by the 
AGM 2020 are applicable until further notice  However, 
since the general meeting shall adopt guidelines for 
remuneration to senior executives at least every fourth 
year, the Board will present a proposal for new guidelines 
for remuneration to senior executives for approval by the 
AGM 2024 to be applicable until further notice 
Proposal guidelines for remuneration to senior 
executives from 2024
The Board of Directors of Hexagon AB (publ) intends 
to propose that the AGM 2024 resolves on updated 
guidelines for remuneration to the President and CEO 
and other senior executives as follows  The changes 
in the Board of Directors’ proposal compared with the 
current guidelines are that the guidelines have been 
aligned with the company’s updated financial targets  
In addition, the guidelines have been supplemented 
with information on the notice period for other senior 
executives upon termination by the senior executive, as 
well as a clarification in relation to the maximum notice 
salary, other employment benefits and severance pay 
that may in total be paid upon termination  Other senior 
executives are defined as members of the Executive 
Leadership  The guidelines are applicable to remuneration 
agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, 
after adoption of the guidelines by the AGM 2024  These 
guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or 
approved by the general meeting  
A prerequisite for the successful implementation of 
the company’s business and safeguarding of its long-
term interests, including its sustainability, is that the 
company is able to attract and retain qualified senior 
executives  To this end, it is necessary that the company 
offers competitive remuneration on market terms  These 
guidelines enable the company to offer the executive 
management a competitive total remuneration  
Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines 
shall aim to promote the company’s business strategy and 
long-term interests, including its sustainability 
The remuneration shall be on market terms and consist 
of fixed salary, variable remuneration, other benefits 
and pension  Additionally, the general meeting may – 
irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on, among other 
things, share-related or share-price related incentive 
programmes  The satisfaction of criteria for awarding 
variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a 
period of one year  The variable cash remuneration is 
capped and shall be maximised at up to 150 per cent of the 
fixed annual cash salary  
For senior executives, pension benefits shall be paid 
not earlier than from the age of 60 years  As a general 
guideline, pension benefits for the CEO, including health 
insurance, shall be fee based  Variable cash remuneration 
shall not qualify for pension benefits  The pension 
premiums for premium defined pension shall amount 
to not more than 20 per cent of the fixed annual cash 
salary  As a general guideline, pension benefits for other 
executives, including health insurance, shall be fee based  
Deviations from this general guideline may be made when 
appointing new senior executives whose employment 
agreements already comprise benefit-based pension 
plans or if the executive is covered by benefit pensions 
in accordance with mandatory collective agreement 
provisions  Variable cash remuneration shall qualify for 
pension benefits only to the extent required by mandatory 
collective agreement provisions applicable to the 
executive  The pension premiums for premium defined 
pension shall amount to not more than 25 per cent of the 
fixed annual cash salary  Other benefits may include, for 
example, life insurance, medical insurance and company 
cars  Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits 
may amount to not more than two per cent of the fixed 
annual cash salary 
For employments governed by rules other than Swedish, 
adjustments may be made for compliance with mandatory 
rules or established local practice, taking into account, 
to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these 
guidelines 
The notice period for the President and CEO is six months  
Upon termination by the company or in case of a change 
of principal ownership the President and CEO is entitled 
to severance pay equal to 18 months of salary  The period 
of notice for other senior executives is a maximum of 24 
months upon termination by the company, and a maximum 
of six months upon termination by the senior executive  
Basic salary and other employment benefits during the 
notice period may together with severance pay not exceed 
an amount equivalent to the basic cash salary for 24 
months  When the employment is terminated by the senior 
executive, no severance pay shall be paid 
The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to 
individualised predetermined and measurable criteria  
The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the 
company’s business strategy and long-term interests, 
including its sustainability, by for example being clearly 
linked to the business strategy or promote the executive’s 
long-term development  The variable cash remuneration

is based on results and other financial targets, such as 
organic growth and the cash conversion target rate  The

contributes to the company’s business strategy, long-term 
interests and sustainability

based on Swedish legislation, primarily the Swedish 
Companies Act, Hexagon’s Articles of Association, the 
Board of Directors’ internal rules, Nasdaq Stockholm’s 
rules and regulations, the Swedish Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”) and regulations and recommendations 
issued by relevant organisations 
Hexagon applies the Code, which is based on the principle 
“comply or explain”  Hexagon did not note any deviations 
from the Code for the 2023 financial year 
This corporate governance report has been prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the Annual Accounts 
Act and the Code and has, by virtue of Section 6, 
paragraph 8 of the Annual Accounts Act, been issued as a 
document separate from the annual report 
Ownership structure and share information 
At 31 December 2023, Hexagon’s share capital was EUR 
85,761,451 represented by 2,705,477,888 shares, of 
which 110,250,000 are of Class A with ten votes each and 
2,595,227,888 are of Class B with one vote each  As of 31 
December 2023, Hexagon AB holds in total 21,100,000 
of the company’s own shares of Class B acquired on 
Nasdaq Stockholm  Repurchase of 5,300,000 shares 
was made during 2023 pursuant to the authorisation 
granted by the Annual General Meeting on 2 May 2023  
The authorisation comprises acquisitions on Nasdaq 
Stockholm, on one or more occasions for the period up 
until the Annual General Meeting 2024, of maximum so 
many Series B shares that the company’s holding does 
not exceed 10 per cent of all shares in the company at that 
time  According to the authorisation any acquisitions of 
shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price 
within the share price interval registered at that time, 
where share price interval means the difference between 
the highest buying price and the lowest selling price  The 
Board of Directors was further authorised, for the period 
up until the Annual General Meeting 2024 on one or more 
occasions, to resolve on transfer of the company’s own 
Series B shares  According to the authorisation, transfer 
of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of 10 per 
cent of the total number of shares in the company from 
time to time  A transfer may be made with deviation 
from the shareholders’ preferential rights on Nasdaq 
Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with 
acquisition of a company or a business  Compensation 
for transferred shares can be paid in cash, through an 
issue in kind or a set-off  Transfers of shares on Nasdaq 
Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the 
share price interval registered at that time  Transfer in 
connection with acquisitions may be made at a market 
value assessed by the Board of Directors  The purpose 
of the authorisations is to give the Board of Directors the 
opportunity to adjust the company’s capital structure, to 
finance potential company acquisitions, and as a hedge 
for the company’s share-based incentive programmes  
The purpose of the repurchase during 2023 was to ensure 
Hexagon’s undertakings in respect of the long-term 
incentive programmes (other than delivery of shares 
to participants in the incentive programmes), including 
covering social security costs  The Board of Directors did 
not exercise the authorisation to resolve on transfer of 
own shares during 2023 
The Annual General Meeting held on 2 May 2023 also 
authorised the Board of Directors to, with or without 
deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights, and 
with or without provisions for contribution in kind, setoff 
or other conditions, resolve to issue Series B shares, 
convertibles and or warrants (with rights to subscribe for 
or convert into Series B shares)  The authorisation may 
be utilised on one or more occasions during the period 
up until the Annual General Meeting 2024  By resolutions 
in accordance with the authorisation, the number of 
shares may be increased by a number corresponding to 
a maximum of 10 percent of the number of outstanding 
shares in the company at the time when the Board of 
Directors first uses the authorisation  The purpose of 
the authorisation is to ensure financing of acquisitions 
of companies, part of companies or businesses or to 
strengthen the company’s capital base and equity/ 
assets ratio  In case of deviation from the shareholders’ 
preferential rights, issues by virtue of the authorisation 
shall be made on market conditions 
Melker Schörling AB, the single largest shareholder in 
Hexagon, held a total of 110,250,000 Class A shares and 
471,081,440 Class B shares at year-end 2023, representing 
42 6 per cent of the votes and 21 5 per cent of the 
capital  No other shareholder has any direct or indirect 
shareholding representing 10 per cent or more of the total 
votes 
To the best of the knowledge of the Board of Directors (the 
“Board”), there are no shareholder agreements or similar 
agreements between the shareholders of Hexagon with 
the purpose of exercising joint control of the company  
The Board also is not aware of any agreements that could 
lead to a change in control of the company or that could 
prevent the transfer of shares of the company

regions and certain specific Group staff functions, totals 
13 persons  Executive Leadership is responsible for the 
overall business development and the apportioning of 
financial resources between the business areas, as well as 
matters involving financing and capital structure  Regular 
management meetings constitute Hexagon’s forum 
for implementing overall controls down to a particular 
business operation and in turn, down to the individual 
company level
Operations 
In financial terms, Hexagon’s business operations 
are controlled on the basis of the return on capital 
employed  This requires focus on maximising operating 
earnings and minimising working capital  Hexagon’s 
organisational structure is decentralised with central 
oversight and coordination  Targets, guidelines and 
strategies are set centrally in collaboration with the 
business units  Managers assume overall responsibility 
for their respective business and pursue the clearly stated 
objectives

Internal control pertaining to financial reporting
The Annual Accounts Act and the Code stipulate that 
the Board of Directors must submit a report on the key 
aspects of the company’s systems for internal controls 
and risk management regarding financial reports  
Internal control pertaining to financial reporting is a 
process that involves the Board, company management 
and other personnel  The process has been designed 
so that it provides assurance of the reliability of the 
external reporting  According to a generally accepted 
framework that has been established for this purpose, 
internal control is usually described from five different 
perspectives:
1  Control environment
Hexagon’s organisation is designed to facilitate rapid 
decision making  Accordingly, operational decisions 
are taken at the business area or subsidiary level, while 
decisions concerning strategies, acquisitions and company-
wide financial matters are taken by the company’s 
Board and Executive Leadership  The organisation is 
characterised by well-defined allocation of responsibility 
and well-functioning and well-established governance 
and control systems, which apply to all Hexagon units  
The basis for the internal control pertaining to financial 
reporting is comprised of an overall control environment 
in which the organisation, decision-making routes, 
authorities and responsibilities have been documented 
and communicated in control documents, such as 
Hexagon’s finance policy and reporting instructions 
and in accordance with the authorisation arrangements 
established by the President and CEO 
Hexagon’s functions for financial control are integrated 
by means of a group-wide reporting system  Hexagon’s 
financial control unit engages in close and well-functioning 
cooperation with the subsidiaries’ controllers in terms of 
the financial statements and the reporting process  The 
Board’s monitoring of the company’s assessment of its 
internal control includes contacts with the company’s 
auditor  Hexagon has no internal audit function, since 
the functions described above satisfy this need  All 
of Hexagon’s subsidiaries report complete financial 
statements on a monthly basis  This reporting provides the 
basis for Hexagon’s consolidated financial reporting  Each 
legal entity has a controller responsible for the financial 
control and for ensuring that the financial reports are 
correct, complete and delivered in time for consolidated 
financial reporting 
2  Risk assessment
The significant risks affecting the internal control of 
financial reporting are identified and managed at group, 
business area, subsidiary and unit level  Within the Board, 
the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that 
significant financial risks and the risk of error in financial 
reporting is identified and managed in a manner that 
ensures correct financial reporting  Special priority has 
been assigned to identifying processes that, to some 
extent, give rise to a higher risk of significant error due to 
the complexity of the process or of the contexts in which 
major values are involved 
3  Control activities
The risks identified with respect to the financial reporting 
process are managed via the company’s control activities  
The control activities are designed to prevent, uncover and 
correct errors and non-conformities  Their management 
is conducted by means of manual controls in the form of, 
for example, reconciliations, automatic controls using IT 
systems and general controls conducted in the underlying 
IT environment  Detailed analyses of financial results and 
evaluation in relation to budget and forecasts supplement 
the business-specific controls and provide general 
confirmation of the quality of the financial reporting 
4  Information and communication
To ensure the completeness and correctness of financial 
reporting, Hexagon has formulated information and 
communication guidelines designed to ensure that 
relevant and significant information is exchanged within 
the business, within the particular unit and to and from 
management and the Board  Guidelines, handbooks and 
job descriptions pertaining to the financial process are 
communicated between management and personnel and 
are accessible electronically and or in a printed format  
The Board receives regular feedback in respect of the 
internal control process from the Audit Committee  To 
ensure that the external communication of information 
is correct and complete, Hexagon complies with a Board 
approved information policy that stipulates what may be 
communicated, by whom and in what manner 
5  Monitoring activities
The efficiency of the process for risk assessment and 
the implementation of control activities are reviewed 
continuously  The follow-up pertains to both formal and 
informal procedures used by the officers responsible 
at each level  The procedures incorporate the review of 
financial results in relation to budget and plans, analyses 
and key figures  The Board obtains current and regular 
reports on Hexagon’s financial position and performance  
At each Board meeting, the company’s financial position is 
addressed and, on a monthly basis, management analyses 
the company’s financial reporting at a detailed level  
The Audit Committee follows up the financial reporting 
at its meetings and receives reports from the auditors 
describing their observations

Auditor’s report on the corporate 
governance statement
To the general meeting of the shareholders of Hexagon AB 
(publ), corporate identity number 556190-4771
Engagement and responsibility
It is the board of directors who is responsible for the 
corporate governance statement for the year 2023 on 
pages 24–30 and that it has been prepared in accordance 
with the Annual Accounts Act  
The scope of the audit
Our examination has been conducted in accordance with 
FAR’s auditing standard RevR 16 The auditor’s examination 
of the corporate governance statement  This means that 
our examination of the corporate governance statement 
is different and substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in 
Sweden  We believe that the examination has provided us 
with sufficient basis for our opinions 
Opinions
A corporate governance statement has been prepared  
Disclosures in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the 
second paragraph points 2-6 the Annual Accounts Act 
and chapter 7 section 31 the second paragraph the same 
law are consistent with the annual accounts and the 
consolidated accounts and are in accordance with the 
Annual Accounts Act

future growth strategy is to actively pursue stra-
tegic acquisitions of companies and businesses  
It cannot be guaranteed, however, that Hexagon 
will be able to find suitable acquisition targets, 
nor can it be guaranteed that the necessary 
financing for future acquisition targets can be 
obtained on terms acceptable to Hexagon, or 
at all  A lack of acquisition financing or suitable 
acquisition targets may lead to a decreasing 
growth rate for Hexagon 
Acquisitions entail multiple risk  The acquired 
entities’ relations with customers, suppliers and 
key personnel may be negatively affected by the 
acquisition  There is also a risk that integration 
processes may prove more costly or more time 
consuming than estimated and that anticipated 
synergies in whole or in part fail to materialise 
or that positive impacts on earnings may take 
longer to realise than expected  An acquisition 
of a company that is not conducting its business 
in a sustainable way or in compliance with Hexa-
gon’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may 
have a negative impact on Hexagon’s reputation 
and brand, even despite Hexagon’s efforts to 
promptly remediate such conditions 
Hexagon monitors many companies to find acqui-
sitions that can strengthen the Group’s product 
portfolio or improve its distribution network  
Potential targets are regularly evaluated based 
on financial, technology and commercial grounds  
Every acquisition candidate’s potential place in 
the Group is determined based on synergy sim-
ulations and implementation strategies  Every 
effort to complete a thorough due diligence is 
made in order to evaluate potential risks and 
there are well-established procedures and 
structures for pricing, acquiring and integrating 
acquired companies 
From 2000 to date, Hexagon completed more 
than 190 acquisitions  Based on its extensive 
experience in acquisitions and integration and 
clear strategies and goals, Hexagon is well posi-
tioned to successfully integrate acquired com-
panies into the Group  In Hexagon’s standard due 
diligence process, a number of risk management, 
compliance and sustainability elements are 
included, such as detailed consideration about 
the internal controls of the target company, qual-
ity business practices, environmental matters, 
employee matters, ISO (International Organ-
isation for Standardisation) or other industry 
certifications, and compliance programmes of 
the target, including those related to anti-corrup-
tion/FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and 
export controls

Impact of the economy and financial markets
Hexagon engages in worldwide operations that 
are dependent on global economic and financial 
market conditions, as well as conditions that are 
unique to certain countries or regions  General 
economic and financial market conditions includ-
ing the interest rate environment, affect the incli-
nation and the capabilities of Hexagon’s existing 
and potential customers to invest in various 
technologies  Weak macroeconomic conditions 
globally or in part of the world may therefore 
result in lower market growth that falls below 
expectations and may reduce revenues for Hexa-
gon, or it may have other effects, like extending 
the sales cycle  
The resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic or 
new variants could have an impact on important 
Hexagon customer industries, and an increase 
of raw material and intermediate goods costs 
could impact Hexagon’s sales potential and cost 
structure  While the duration and severity of those 
impacts on Hexagon’s business are highly uncer-
tain, they could have an adverse effect on the busi-
ness, financial condition and results of operations 
in many ways, including disruptions in Hexagon’s 
supply chains 
Hexagon’s business is widely spread geo-
graphically, with a broad customer base within 
numerous market segments which may make the 
Group less sensitive to economic fluctuations in 
individual sectors, industries and geographical 
regions  Potential negative effects of a downturn 
in the developed world may, for example, be par-
tially off-set by growth in emerging markets and 
vice-versa 
While Hexagon has developed and continues 
to develop plans intended to help mitigate the 
negative impact of economic downturns on the 
business, a protracted event would likely limit the 
effectiveness of those mitigation efforts 
Geopolitical risks
Understanding geopolitical risk, how geography 
and economics influence politics and the rela-
tions between countries, is important in a world 
that has become more closely intertwined due 
to the rise of globalisation – and additionally the 
trends of regionalisation that we have observed 
more recently in certain jurisdictions 
Current geopolitical risks include the current war 
in Ukraine and the corresponding global sanc-
tions, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, other politi-
cal and economic uncertainties and the potential 
for further escalation of the trade issues among 
various countries, for example the US and China  
Although it is difficult to assess the evolution 
and impact of intensification of war hostilities, 
ongoing political tensions and international 
economic sanctions could have significant neg-
ative impacts on the global economy and the 
performance of financial markets, interest rates, 
availability of supply and on the markets for raw 
materials 
Understanding how geopolitical risks may affect 
Hexagon’s organisation, activities, operating 
results and strategies is critical to making accu-
rate projections about Hexagon’s future growth 
and profitability  However, what impact the wars, 
crises, pandemics and or an escalating trade com-
plexities will have on commercial activities and/
or global markets, and the demand for Hexagon’s 
products, over the coming years remains uncertain 
and will to some extent depend upon resolution of 
any crises 
In order to mitigate risks that may occur due to 
geopolitics, such as sanctions and or global per-
ception and reputational risk, Hexagon follows 
developments closely while evaluating different 
strategies in order to prepare for and handle 
possible scenarios that may affect Hexagon’s 
organisation and the ability to do business in dif-
ferent parts of the world in the near term and over 
the coming years  Among other things, Hexagon 
mitigates geopolitical risk through its local oper-
ations and localised products, adapted to local 
requirements, which mitigates risks associated 
with international tensions

Competition and price pressure
Parts of Hexagon’s operation are carried out in 
sectors which are subject to price pressure and 
rapid technological change  Hexagon’s ability to 
compete in the market by introducing new and 
successful products with enhanced functionality 
while simultaneously cutting costs on new and 
existing products is of the utmost importance 
in order to retain customers and avoid erosion 
of market share  Other inherent risks exist with 
competitors, such as consolidation or entry into 
Hexagon’s markets by companies with significant 
resources  Such competition may result in price 
reductions, reduced margins or loss of market 
share  
R&D efforts are costly and new product devel-
opment always entails a risk of unsuccessful 
product launches or commercialisation, which 
could have material adverse consequences on 
Hexagon  Further, technological innovation and 
changing trends, such as disruptive technologies, 
technical capabilities, supply chains, new mar-
ket entrants or novel business models, creates 
inherent risks that are difficult to foresee 
Hexagon invests significantly in R&D  The objec-
tives for Hexagon’s R&D division are to transform 
customer needs into products and services and 
to detect and advance market and technology 
opportunities as early as practicable  Introducing 
new products and technologies require active 
intellectual property management to secure 
Hexagon’s technological position

Operational risk management
Operational risks concern risks related to reception of new products and services, dependence on suppliers and risks related to human 
capital  Since the majority of operational risks are attributable to Hexagon’s customer and supplier relations, ongoing risk analyses of 
customers and suppliers are conducted to assess business risks  Operational risks are primarily managed within each subsidiary of 
Hexagon 
Risk
Risk management 
Customers
Hexagon’s business activities are conducted in a 
large number of markets with multiple customer 
categories  In 2023, Surveying was the single 
largest customer category and accounted for 18 
per cent of net sales  For Hexagon, this customer 
category may involve certain risks as a downturn 
or weak development in the surveying sector can 
have a negative impact on Hexagon’s business  
Surveying is followed by customer categories 
Electronics and Manufacturing with 17 per cent, 
Infrastructure and Construction with 12 per cent 
and Power and Energy with 12 per cent  Changing 
demand of Hexagon’s customers is possible as 
technology needs and consumption change over 
time 
Hexagon may face risks, including reputational 
risks, while global conflicts persist, due to unau-
thorised use or misuse of the Group’s products  
Further, the resurgence of the Covid-19 pan-
demic or any other outbreak or pandemic could 
result in delays, cancellations, or changes to user 
and industry conferences and other marketing 
events relating to Hexagon’s solutions, including 
its own customer and partner activities, which 
may negatively impact the ability to obtain new 
and retain existing customers, and effectively 
market Hexagon’s solutions 
Hexagon has a favourable risk diversification in 
products and geographical areas, and no single 
customer or customer category is decisive for 
the Group’s performance  The largest customer 
represents approximately 1 per cent of the 
Group’s total net sales  Credit risk in customer 
receivables accounts for the majority of Hexa-
gon’s counterparty risk  
Hexagon’s compliance programme addresses 
all principles contained in the Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics, including export controls, 
customs, anti-corruption, competition, pub-
lic contracting and data privacy  Hexagon is 
committed to complying with appropriate legal 
requirements, such as those listed above, and 
the Group’s compliance efforts aim to safeguard 
peace and security by preventing the unlawful 
trading of items (i e  goods, software or technol-
ogy) or diversion to destinations where they may 
be used for illegal purposes 
Risk
Risk management 
Suppliers
Hexagon’s hardware products consist of compo-
nents from several different suppliers  To be in a 
position to sell and deliver solutions to custom-
ers, Hexagon is dependent upon deliveries from 
third parties in accordance with agreed require-
ments relating to, for example, quantity, quality 
and delivery times  Erroneous or default deliv-
eries by suppliers can cause delay or default in 
Hexagon’s deliveries, which can result in reduced 
sales  Further, Hexagon uses subcontractors, 
distributors, resellers and other representatives  
Hexagon may face risks, including reputational 
risks, if suppliers do not maintain a high level of 
business ethics in terms of, for example human 
rights working conditions and corruption
The resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic could 
temporarily result in an inability to meet in per-
son or otherwise effectively communicate with 
current or potential vendors, suppliers, and part-
ners, which may negatively affect current and 
future relationships with such vendors, suppliers, 
and partners and Hexagon’s ability to generate 
demand for solutions 
If there were to be unmanaged negative impacts 
following a supplier’s noncompliance with Hexa-
gon’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and/
or Hexagon’s Supplier Code of Conduct, 
it may result in reputational risks for Hexagon 
Hexagon seeks a favourable risk diversification, 
and no single supplier is decisive for the Group’s 
performance  The largest supplier accounted 
for approximately 1 per cent of Hexagon’s total 
net sales in 2023  To minimise the risk of supply 
shortages or of excessive price variations among 
suppliers, Hexagon works actively to coordinate 
sourcing within the Group and to identify alterna-
tive suppliers for strategic components  Supplier 
risk surveys are performed (including those by 
Hexagon’s external partner) in order to identify 
and mitigate risks associated with the suppliers’ 
operations 
Hexagon also has a sustainability risk assess-
ment and supplier audit process in place, includ-
ing handling the risk of breaches in human rights  
Hexagon has a compliance programme in place 
for suppliers to manage social and ethical risks 
and the Group regularly conducts supplier audits 
to ensure suppliers are compliant with the Hexa-
gon’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and 
Hexagon’s Supplier Code of Conduct

Production and distribution units
Hexagon’s production and distribution units are 
exposed to risks (fire, explosion, natural hazards, 
machinery damages, cyber threats, infrastruc-
ture failures, power outages, etc ) that could lead 
to property damage and business interruption  
This risk may be further accentuated by climate 
change, which may impact the frequency and 
severity of many of these events 
Risk grading surveys are performed (including by 
Hexagon’s external partner) in order to identify 
and mitigate risks as well as support local man-
agement in their loss prevention work  Surveys 
are conducted with each subsidiary in accor-
dance with a long-term plan  Hexagon has imple-
mented ISO 9001 at the majority of the largest 
production sites  
Human capital
The resignation of key employees or Hexagon’s 
failure to attract skilled and diverse personnel 
to all different levels within the organisation may 
have an adverse impact on the Group’s opera-
tions  Further, maintaining Hexagon’s company 
culture is critical to attracting and retaining top 
talent 
In the event that all or a portion of Hexagon’s 
workforce becomes unable or unwilling to 
work on-site or travel as a result of event can-
cellations, facility closures, shelter-in-place, 
travel and other restrictions and changes in 
industry practice due to any causes (including 
pandemics), these workforce disruptions could 
adversely affect Hexagon’s ability to operate, 
including to develop, manufacture, generate 
sales of, promote, market and deliver hardware 
and software products, solutions and services, 
and provide customer support  Adoption of new 
laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws 
or regulations, that may be imposed as a result of 
the resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic, or any 
other wide-spread public health situation, may 
cause risks in the company’s ability to hire and 
retain skilled professionals 
Since future success is largely dependent on the 
capacity to retain, recruit and develop skilled 
staff, being an attractive employer to both 
potential and existing employees is an important 
success factor for Hexagon  Group and business 
area management jointly handle risks associated 
with human capital  Hexagon works with a struc-
tured approach to HR and market-based remu-
neration to better ensure employee satisfaction  
Hexagon uses employee engagement as the 
overall measure in the employee survey  
In order to attract skilled employees, Hexagon 
cooperates with multiple universities and col-
leges around the world, aiming at training, devel-
oping and hiring students with industry-ready 
skills 
Environment
Hexagon provides sensors, software and data 
to its customers  Approximately 60 per cent of 
the revenues are from software and services  
Hexagon does not currently operate any busi-
ness that require carbon credits, but that could 
change in the future  However, stricter regulation 
of environmental matters can result in increased 
costs or further investments for the companies 
within Hexagon which are subject to such reg-
ulation  Climate change can result in natural 
disasters and increase the risk of physical dam-
age on assets and supply shortages  Hexagon is 
impacted by such legislation in a manner similar 
to other companies operating in these fields 
Hexagon believes that it is in material compli-
ance with all applicable laws and obligations 
and obtains relevant approvals where needed  
Hexagon continuously monitors anticipated 
and implemented changes in legislation in the 
countries in which it operates and potential envi-
ronmental risks are regulary monitored  Hexagon 
routinely assesses the risk of climate change 
on its operations as part of its insurance pro-
gramme  Hexagon has implemented ISO 14001 at 
the majority of the largest production sites and 
has implemented a sustainability programme to 
reduce its carbon impact in its own operations 
and in its value chain  
Business ethics and corruption
Corruption negatively impacts communities and 
overall global economic development and erodes 
the trust necessary to build a stable business 
environment  Additionally, under the anit-cor-
ruption laws of many jurisdictions, businesses 
such as Hexagon may potentially be held liable 
for the corrupt actions taken by employees, stra-
tegic or local partners or other representatives  
If Hexagon or its intermediaries fail to comply 
with anti-corruption laws, governmental author-
ities could potentially seek to impose civil and/
or criminal fines and penalties which could have 
an adverse effect on Hexagon’s business and 
reputation  
For Hexagon, anti-corruption compliance is of 
utmost importance for many reasons, and it 
helps Hexagon advance its financial interests, 
sustainability goals and brand value  
Hexagon has a robust Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Compliance 
Programme in place, covering the entire Group, 
including policies, processes and training  The 
anti-corruption compliance documents include 
policies in such areas as gifts and entertainment 
(both to and from third parties), hiring candidates 
with government connections and engaging in 
and transacting business with third parties

Cyber risks and data protection
Hexagon relies on IT systems in its operations  
Disruptions or faults in critical systems may have 
a negative impact on Hexagon’s operations, 
including impact on production, Hexagon’s tangi-
ble and intellectual property and, in some cases, 
the intellectual property and operations of exter-
nal parties  Advances in digital technology and 
increases in device connectivity have presented 
new security challenges as employees and Hexa-
gon’s partners, customers and service providers 
to a greater extent, work remotely from non-cor-
porate managed networks 
Incidents may also lead to data privacy infringe-
ments such as unauthorised access, leakage 
or loss of data  Data security and integrity are 
critical issues for Hexagon  Under the GDPR, and 
other analogous legislation in various jurisdic-
tions, and ePrivacy regulations, Hexagon has firm 
legal requirements to protect against personal 
information (PI) data breaches  The regulations 
extend to all vendors that Hexagon uses to col-
lect, store and process PI data on its behalf  In 
China and several other jurisdictions, there are 
also similar laws in place to protect various data 
types, including PI data  It is critical for Hexagon 
to protect and secure all data as the costs of 
remediating a serious breach are high and can 
also be damaging to Hexagon’s reputation 
Cyber security risks are increasing in society in 
general and Hexagon works continuously to keep 
the Group’s IT systems protected  In addition, 
Hexagon invests in enhanced disaster recovery 
and data storage capabilities, cyber security 
expertise and tools, and other appropriate risk 
mitigation techniques  Hexagon also mitigates 
IT-related risks through contracts with external 
parties 
Hexagon has mandated that all divisions must 
implement a recognised cybersecurity frame-
work  Hexagon applies the standards of ISO27001 
and NIST-800-53  Additionally, SOC1 and SOC2, 
and other industry specific certifications, are fol-
lowed and verified where appropriate

Financial risk management
Financial risks are primarely managed at the Group level  
The Group Treasury Policy, which is updated and approved 
annually by the Board of Directors, stipulates the rules and 
limitations for the management of financial risks throughout 
the Group  Hexagon’s internal bank coordinates the 
management of financial risks and is also responsible for the 
Group’s external borrowing and internal financing  Additional 
financial risks include, but are not limited to, the risks of 
varying business results, seasonal variation, and changes to 
accounting principles (or application thereof) 
Risk

Currency
Hexagon’s operations are conducted interna-
tionally  During 2023, total operating earnings, 
excluding adjustments, from operations in 
currencies other than EUR amounted to an 
equivalent of 1,271 5 MEUR (1,232 7)  Of these 
currencies, CHF, CNY and USD have the biggest 
impact on Hexagon’s earnings and net assets  
Currency risk is the risk that currency exchange 
rate fluctuations will have an adverse effect on 
the income statement, balance sheet and or 
cash flow  
Sales and purchases of goods and services in 
currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional 
currency give rise to transaction exposure  
Translation exposure arises when the income 
statement and balance sheet are translated into 
EUR  The balance sheet translation exposure 
might substantially affect other comprehensive 
income negatively  Furthermore, the compara-
bility of Hexagon’s earnings between periods is 
affected by changes in currency exchange rates  
The income statement translation exposure is 
described in the table below for the currencies 
having the largest impact on Hexagon’s earnings 
and net assets, including the effect on Hexagon’s 
operating earnings in 2023

1) Compared to EUR and 2022
Hexagon’s reporting currency is EUR, which has a 
stabilising effect on certain key ratios that are of 
importance to Hexagon’s cost of capital 
As much as possible, currency transaction 
exposure is concentrated in the countries where 
the manufacturing entities are located  This is 
achieved by invoicing the sales entities in their 
respective functional currency by the manufac-
turing entities  According to the Group’s financial 
policy, currency transaction exposure should not 
be hedged using external financial instruments  
The rationale for this is that the vast majority of 
transactions entail a short period of time from 
order to payment  Moreover, a transaction hedge 
only postpones the effect of a change in currency 
rates 
The translation exposure can be mitigated by 
denominating borrowings in the same currency 
as the corresponding net assets  In order to 
have the volatility in net debt at an acceptable 
level, the majority of the borrowings is currently 
denominated in EUR

Hexagon Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
Interest
The interest rate risk is the risk that changes in 
market interest rates will adversely affect the 
Group’s net interest expense and or cash flow  
Interest rate exposure arises primarily from out-
standing loans  The impact on the Group’s net 
interest expense depends, among other things, 
on the average interest rate for borrowings  
Futher, increasing interest rate may have an 
impact on Hexagon’s customers, vendors and 
suppliers  For example, customers may invest 
less in Hexagon solutions, or the sales cycle may 
lengthen  Vendors and suppliers may reduce 
inventory levels of available products to deliver 
to Hexagon, which could extend delivery times, or 
could fail to fulfil their obligations 
In accordance with the Group Treasury Policy, 
the average interest rate duration of the exter-
nal debt is to be between 6 months and 3 years  
During the year, interest rate derivatives were 
used to manage the interest rate risk 
Customer interest-rate sensitivity is mitigated 
by the variety of products and services at various 
prices that Hexagon offers  Supplier and vendor 
interest-rate sensitivity mitigate through moni-
toring key vendors and suppliers 
Credit
Credit risk, i e , the risk that customers may 
be unable to fulfil their payment obligations, 
accounts for the majority of Hexagon’s counter-
party risk  
Financial credit risk is the exposure to default of 
counterparties with which Hexagon has invested 
cash or has entered into forward exchange con-
tracts or other financial instruments 
Through a combination of geographical and indus-
try diversification of customers, the risk for signifi-
cant credit losses is reduced  
To reduce Hexagon’s financial credit risk, surplus 
cash is only invested with a limited number of 
approved banks and derivative transactions are 
only conducted with counterparties where an 
ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Asso-
ciation) netting agreement has been established  
As Hexagon is a net borrower, excess liquidity 
is primarily used to repay external debt and 
therefore the average surplus cash invested with 
banks is kept as low as possible 
Liquidity
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet 
payment obligations in full as they become due 
or only being able to do so at materially disadvan-
tageous terms due to lack of cash resources 
The Group Treasury Policy states that the total 
liquidity reserve shall at all times be at least 10 
per cent of forecasted annual net sales  A suffi-
cient liquidity reserve limits the risk of not being 
able to meet payment obligations in full when 
they become due  At year-end 2023, cash and 
unutilised credit limits totalled 1,268 6 MEUR 
(1,429 7) 
Refinancing
Refinancing risk refers to the risk that Hexagon 
does not have sufficient financing available when 
needed to refinance maturing debt, because 
existing lenders decline to provide additional 
credit or difficulties arise in procuring new lines 
of credit at a given point in time  Hexagon’s ability 
to satisfy future capital needs is to a large degree 
dependent on successful sales of the Group’s 
products and services  There is no guarantee 
that Hexagon will be able to generate necessary 
capital from sales or from third party financ-
ing arrangements  In this regard, the general 
development of the capital and credit markets 
is also of major importance  Hexagon, moreover, 
requires sufficient financing in order to refinance 
maturing debt  Securing these requirements 
demands a strong financial position of the Group, 
combined with active measures to ensure access 
to credit  There is no guarantee that Hexagon will 
be able to raise sufficient funds in order to refi-
nance maturing debt 
In order to ensure that appropriate financing 
is in place and to decrease refinancing risk, no 
more than 20 per cent of the Group’s gross debt, 
including committed credit facilities, is allowed 
to mature within the succeeding 12 months 
unless replacement facilities have been entered 
into  
Hexagon’s main sources of financing consist of: 
• A multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF) 
established during 2021  The RCF amounts to 
1,500 MEUR with a tenor of 5+1+1 years 
• A Swedish Medium-Term Note Programme 
(MTN) established during 2014  The MTN pro-
gramme amounts to 20,000 MSEK 
and gives Hexagon the option to issue bonds 
with tenors of up 
to 6 years 
• A Swedish Commercial Paper Programme (CP) 
established during 2012  The CP programme 
gives Hexagon the option to issue commercial 
paper for a total amount of 15,000 MSEK with 
tenor up to 12 months 
Insurable risk
Hexagon’s operations, assets and staff are to a 
certain degree exposed to various risks of dam-
ages, losses and injuries which could tentatively 
threaten the Group’s business continuity, earn-
ings, financial assets and personnel 
To ensure a well-balanced insurance coverage 
and financial economies of scale, Hexagon’s 
insurance programme includes, among other 
things, group-wide property and liability insur-
ance, travel insurance, errors and omissions 
insurance and transport insurance, as well 
as several other programmes, combined with 
local insurance coverage wherever needed  The 
insurance programme is periodically amended 
so that owned risk and insured risk are optimally 
balanced

Risk
Risk management 
Legislation and regulation
Hexagon’s main markets are subject to extensive 
regulation and applicable laws  Hexagon’s oper-
ations may be affected by regulatory changes, 
tax changes (including to customs duties) and 
other trading obstacles, political changes and 
pricing and currency controls, as well as other 
government legislation and restrictions in the 
countries where Hexagon is active  For example, 
more stringent regulations have been passed 
or are being developed in several jurisdictions 
relating to the use of artificial intelligence in 
product development and solutions deployment  
In addition, Hexagon remains subject to data 
protection regulations, which continue to evolve  
These changing requirements and more strin-
gent rules impose a risk of non-compliance with 
these regulations, which could potentially result 
in substantial legal fees and damage to Hexa-
gon’s reputation  Additional areas of regulatory 
uncertainty include laws and regulations related 
to export controls and sanctions, foreign-di-
rect investment controls and disclosures, and 
environmental sustainability (including climate 
change)  New laws and regulations could result 
in increased compliance and operating costs  
Further, delivery of products and services that 
comply with contractual requirements may pres-
ent certain risks at times, particularly in light of 
frequent regulatory change, natural disasters, 
wars and regional conflicts, and pandemics and 
similar force majeure events 
Hexagon closely monitors legislation, regulations 
and applicable ordinances in each market and 
seeks to adapt the business to identified future 
changes in each market  The Group legal function 
is staffed with experienced professionals and 
Hexagon also regularly consults with external 
subject matter experts to address legal risk man-
agement topics 
To manage country- specific risks, Hexagon 
observes local legislation and monitors political 
developments in the countries where the Group 
conducts operations  To this effect, Hexagon has 
adopted a worldwide compliance programme 
across the Group to ensure that its subsidiaries 
at all times comply with all applicable legislation, 
rules and ordinances  Hexagon’s compliance 
programme is reviewed and updated as needed 
based on changes in laws and regulations  Fur-
ther, Hexagon will continue to comply with all 
applicable export control restrictions and sanc-
tions laws relevant to our operations and with the 
rules of ethics and international standards

that submitted applications for registration will 
be granted  Furthermore, there is a risk that new 
technologies and products are developed which 
circumvent or replace Hexagon’s intellectual 
property rights  Infringement disputes, and legal 
disputes in general, can be costly and time con-
suming and may therefore adversely affect Hexa-
gon’s business  Additionally, third parties may 
assert that Hexagon’s products infringe their 
intellectual property rights 
Hexagon seeks to protect its technology innova-
tions to safeguard the returns on the resources 
that Hexagon assigns to R&D  The Group strives 
to protect its technical innovations through pat-
ents, copyrights, and trade secrets and protects 
its intellectual property rights through legal 
proceedings when warranted  Such intellectual 
property rights can generally only be enforced in 
jurisdictions that have granted such protections 
or recognise these rights

Tax
Hexagon operates through subsidiaries in a num-
ber of jurisdictions and all cross-border transac-
tions are normally a tax risk because there are no 
global transfer pricing rules  Local tax authorities 
follow their own local transfer pricing rules and 
authorities interpret transfer pricing guidelines 
differently  Risks are also presented by new 
accounting rules or interpretations by the applica-
ble governing bodies  Hexagon interacts with local 
taxing authorities and frequently has several ongo-
ing tax audits in progress 
Hexagon’s interpretation of prevailing tax law, 
tax treaties, OECD guidelines and agreements 
entered into with foreign tax authorities may 
be challenged by tax authorities in some coun-
tries  Rules and guidelines may also be subject 
to future changes which can have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s tax position  Furthermore, 
a change in the business or part of the business 
can have an impact on agreements entered into 
with tax authorities in some tax jurisdictions 
The tax rate may increase if large acquisitions are 
made in high tax jurisdictions or if the corporate 
tax rates change in countries where Hexagon car-
ries out substantial business 
Transactions between Group companies are car-
ried out in accordance with Hexagon’s interpre-
tation of prevailing tax laws, tax treaties, OECD’s 
guidelines and agreements entered into with for-
eign tax authorities  Hexagon has a tax policy that 
is annually reviewed and adopted by its Board of 
Directors

Hexagon commitment to ethics and compliance 
Introduction
Hexagon is dedicated to upholding the highest standards 
of ethics and compliance within all aspects of our 
operations  Our Ethics and Compliance System (“System”) 
is designed to detect, prevent, and respond effectively 
to legal risks and misconduct, ensuring that our business 
practices not only comply with applicable laws and 
regulations but also align with recognised best practices, 
such as the 10 business principles recommended by 
Transparency International and the UN Global Compact 
Standards  This System contributes to Hexagon’s culture 
of integrity, transparency, and reliability  
System design 
Risk assessment
Hexagon conducts regular risk assessments to identify 
and prioritise legal and compliance risks associated with 
our global operations  This proactive approach enables 
us to tailor our compliance strategies and effectively 
allocate resources, addressing the unique challenges of 
our diverse and global business environments  Our risk 
management process evolves continually, incorporating 
insights from industry trends, regulatory changes, 
external professionals and our own experiences to refine 
our focus and resource allocation 
System architecture
At the top of our System are our Code of Business Conduct 
and Ethics and Supplier Code of Conduct  These pivotal 
documents form the bedrock of our ethical culture, 
providing overarching guidance to navigate business 
operations with integrity  These documents are regularly 
reviewed and updated to reflect evolving legal and 
industry standards  Integral to the interpretation of all 
System documents, these Codes ensure that our ethical 
directives reach every facet of our operations 
The Ethics and Compliance Administration Manual 
sets out the System’s governance and accountability 
by assigning the roles and responsibilities to both 
management leadership and the Compliance Team 
The System is intentionally designed with a clear focus 
on key areas of heightened risk, shaping our specific 
Compliance Programmes to cover critical aspects such 
as anti-corruption, competition, public contracting, 
trade (including export and customs compliance), data 
protection, and sustainability (ESG)  These Compliance 
Programmes are operationalised through comprehensive 
manuals, procedures, instructions, guidance, worksheets, 
templates, and other tools that enable practical 
compliance implementation  
In addition to these core areas, the System is augmented 
by further policies and procedures that address other 
areas of heightened risk, further fortifying our compliance 
infrastructure  Accessibility of our System documentation 
is paramount; hence, we ensure it is readily available to all 
employees, often in many different languages 
For broader transparency, our Codes, summaries of our 
Compliance Programmes, and key policies are publicly 
accessible on our website  
Training and communication
Effective training and communication are vital 
components of our System, ensuring that our global 
workforce is well-informed and aligned with our ethics 
and compliance standards  Our multifaceted approach 
includes in-person and online training sessions, strategic 
management meetings, external training opportunities, 
internal compliance briefings, and ad-hoc guidance 
addressing emerging risks  In addition, annually, Hexagon 
defines a compliance plan addressing communication, 
training, and audit activities  This approach ensures 
systematic training on all essential compliance topics for 
every employee, aligning with Hexagon’s commitment to 
an informed and compliant workforce 
We recognise the importance of tailoring training to 
specific roles, which is why our training programmes 
are customised to address the distinct risks and 
responsibilities and needs of different employee groups  
These efforts are enhanced by lessons learned from past 
compliance matters and the influence of internationally 
renown advisors, ensuring that we continually learn and 
improve 
Hexagon enables collaborative efforts across various 
departments - Legal, Finance, Order Fulfillment, Treasury, 
and Supply Chain/Procurement – to further integrate 
compliance processes into our daily operations

Implementation and resources
Commitment from the top
Effective compliance starts with leadership  At Hexagon, 
our senior management and the board of directors are 
deeply committed to fostering a culture of ethics and 
compliance  They demonstrate this commitment by 
consistently emphasising ethical behavior and compliance 
in both their communications and actions  This approach 
ensures that ethics and compliance are central to 
Hexagon’s business strategies, making ethical conduct 
a fundamental part of our decision-making process  
Their proactive efforts to align compliance with business 
objectives and address emerging risks underscore their 
strong commitment to maintaining Hexagon’s ethical 
foundation 
A key practice is the annual Compliance Certification by 
Hexagon Management, which confirmes leadership’s 
commitment to our System  Periodic communications 
throughout the year from various business leaders 
supplement our compliance alignment, ensuring ongoing 
adherence to our standards of integrity 
Governance 
Hexagon’s compliance function, overseen by the Chief 
Compliance Officer (CCO), operates independently and 
maintains direct access to the Board of Directors and 
Audit Committee leadership  The CCO routinely reports 
to these bodies on compliance matters, training activity, 
regulatory developments, and other pertinent activities 
of interest  This reporting mechanism ensures that 
compliance considerations are seamlessly integrated into 
strategic decision-making processes  
The CCO is supported by a global team of compliance 
experts, adequately resourced, both in terms of personnel 
and technology, which ensures effective monitoring, 
auditing and enforcement of compliance activities  The 
Group Compliance Officer together with the Division and 
Regional Compliance Officers and assisted by a large 
network of selected compliance coordinators manage 
and lead the operational implementation of the Ethics and 
Compliance System within all Hexagon entities 
Further, the Hexagon compliance network provides 
guidance, advice, and supports all employees on any issue 
related to compliance
Incentives and disciplinary measures
Hexagon looks for ways to enforce its compliance 
standards through incentives for ethical behavior and 
disciplinary measures for violations  This approach 
ensures accountability and promotes a culture where 
integrity and compliance are valued and rewarded 
Effectiveness in practice
Continuous improvement
Hexagon is committed to the ongoing enhancement of 
the System, ensuring it remains effective in responding 
to evolving challenges  The Strategic Compliance 
Cabinet, a dedicated international team of experience 
compliance and legal professionals, monitors regulatory 
developments and changes in the business landscape to 
propose necessary improvements to the System  
Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our 
compliance framework are also gained through regular 
internal audits, observations of the compliance team and 
whistleblower reports  Additionally, Hexagon has defined 
a set of compliance-related Key Performance Indicators 
(KPIs) to systematically measure and monitor compliance 
activity  These KPIs serve as valuable metrics for 
evaluating the effectiveness of the System and identifying 
areas for improvement  This proactive approach allows us 
to refine and improve our System continually, ensuring our 
compliance strategy is both robust and responsive 
Response to misconduct
Our commitment to upholding the highest standards of 
ethics and compliance is showed by our well-documented 
process for investigating allegations of misconduct  
Our methodology in dealing with misconduct reports 
follows a risk-oriented approach and ensures thorough 
and impartial investigations, identifying root causes, 
implementing effective steps to remediate issues and 
prevent their recurrence  
Hexagon actively promotes a culture of integrity 
and responsibility among its employees, while also 
empowering external stakeholdersincluding suppliers, 
customers, freelancers, contractors, and shareholders 
to report any suspected violations of law or Hexagon’s 
internal policies and procedures  We provide several 
reporting channels to submit such reports 
Since 2021, Hexagon has used an external whistleblower 
reporting system to manage whistleblower reports and 
ensure consistent case management and recordkeeping  
Operational 24/7/365, it provides a secure platform for 
reporting in various languages, either in writing or by 
phone, and allows for confidential submissions  
In 2022, Hexagon introduced the Procedure for Internal 
Reporting and Investigations to establish a uniform 
standard for the management of reports and the conduct 
of investigations  This procedure, while informed by the EU 
Whistleblower Directive’s approach to managing reports 
and conducting investigations, extends its applicability 
beyond the EU Directive’s scope, allowing for a wider range 
of violations to be reported  
Hexagon’s response to reports is adapted to the specifics 
of each case  Typically, the process includes logging the 
report into our case management system, acknowledging 
its receipt within five business days, and conducting a 
preliminary assessment  Based on the findings, we may 
proceed with a detailed investigation or take other action 
on or decide to close the matter  Responsive actions are 
taken as necessary, with updates on the investigation’s 
progress provided to the reporter when appropriate

Directors and Audit Committee 
System evolution through 2023
In 2023, Hexagon demonstrated a proactive and dynamic 
approach to enhancing its compliance framework, 
responding to emerging challenges and integrating 
valuable insights  Below are key developments and actions 
taken to fortify our compliance efforts:
• Strategic personnel additions: Hexagon enhanced its 
compliance team through key appointments, most 
notably adding a Corporate Compliance Counsel 
• Training: Hexagon’s investigation teams have enhanced 
their capabilities through participation in external 
investigator training  This initiative underscores 
our commitment to maintaining a high standard of 
investigative proficiency and ensuring our teams are 
equipped with the latest methodologies and best 
practices  Additionally, many informative training 
sessions were provided to employees 
• Employee engagement: Results from our employee 
surveys on compliance have provided valuable feedback, 
informing our strategy and helping us to tailor our 
compliance programmes to better meet the needs and 
concerns of our workforce 
• Potential Misconduct reporting: Throughout 2023, we 
received 66 reports  Each report was carefully evaluated, 
leading appropriate responses, underscoring our 
unwavering commitment to addressing and rectifying 
potential compliance issues 
• Risk management initiatives: A critical focus has been 
the identification and management of potential diversion 
risks to Russia  We have developed and implemented a 
detailed procedure for identifying and addressing these 
risks 
• Policy implementation: The introduction of the 
ChatGPT Policy and AML/CTF (Anti-Money Laundering/
Counter-Terrorist Financing) Policy marks a significant 
enhancement to our compliance architecture, 
addressing evolving risks and ensuring robust controls 
are in place 
• Continuous improvement: Reflecting our dedication to 
continuous improvement, the Procedure for Internal 
Reporting and Investigations was updated to incorporate 
lessons learned from past incidents  Further, detailed 
instructions have been communicated to Hexagon 
employees on compliance matters impacting their daily 
business activities 
• Conflict of Interest Guidance: The implementation of this 
guidance, along with targeted training for employees, 
highlights Hexagon’s commitment to identifying and 
managing conflicts of interest  The guidance provides 
clear examples of conflicts of interest, mandates their 
disclosure, and explains resolution processes  Following 
its implementation, there has been a notable rise in 
the disclosure and resolution of conflicts of interest, 
demonstrating its effectiveness 
• Guidance for Trade Shows and External Events: This 
guidance aims to prevent misconduct that breaches 
competition laws at trade shows and external events  
It achieves this by offering clear dos and don’ts, 
supplemented with examples and explanations, 
guiding employees to maintain compliance and uphold 
Hexagon’s ethical standards in these settings 
Conclusion
Hexagon remains steadfast in our commitment to 
maintaining the highest standards of ethics and 
compliance  Our dynamic approach to compliance 
management ensures that our System not only meets 
current legal requirements but is also poised to address 
future challenges

operations  2023 was also the year where we successfully 
reached the goal of conducting sustainability audits of 
our key suppliers in what we define as risk areas, aiming 
to ensure that the products and components we source 
are produced in accordance with Hexagon's strict 
environmental and human rights standards  I am glad to 
present our key achievements and improvement areas in 
more detail in this sustainability report  
Having sustainability included in the core of Hexagon’s 
strategy, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
topics are also considered during our acquisitions to 
ensure Hexagon’s long-term success  As part of the due 
diligence process, target companies are assessed on their 
ESG practices, evaluating factors such as compliance 
with regulations, environmental impact, labour practices 
and corporate governance standards  Sustainability 
is also used to identify potential synergies and unlock 
value creation opportunities, ultimately contributing to 
Hexagon's overall success and sustainability impact  
Our greatest opportunity
From a holistic perspective, the area where we can have 
the greatest sustainability impact remains within the 
use of Hexagon technology by our customers  As entire 
Letter from the CSO
Together towards a 
sustainable future
I am proud to conclude 2023 as another very strong year for 
Hexagon from a sustainability perspective  Perhaps most 
notably, the internal momentum that has been built over 
the past several years resulted in us confidently setting new 
ambitious goals related to our carbon footprint  
More specifically, we committed to increasing the ratio of 
renewable energy in our operations to 100% by 2027, to reduce 
our Scope 1 and 2 emissions 95% by 2030 and to reduce 
our Scope 3 emissions 25% by the same deadline, all using 
2022 as the base year  The long-term target to achieve a CO2 
reduction across the full supply chain aligned with net-zero 
by 2050 remains, of course  Our targets and commitments to 
set a net-zero target approved by the Science-Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) have also been recognised as aligned with 
the requirements of the UN Global Compact Forward Faster 
initiative, a global platform for ambitious corporate action 
guiding companies  We are encouraging more companies to join 
us to drive progress across all 17 sustainable development goals 
(SDGs) towards a sustainable future 
Value chain commitment
As the majority of Hexagon’s carbon footprint can be found 
within our supply chain, we have also committed to ensure that 
our major suppliers have CO2 reduction plans, further expanding 
our journey towards a greener future outside of our internal

industries are reshaping their business models and 
processes into becoming more efficient and productive, 
our broad portfolio of software and hardware solutions 
is put to the test to generate sustainable value across 
the world  Hexagon’s core portfolio is dedicated to this 
very purpose, as our design and engineering, production 
software and metrology solutions increase efficiency 
throughout the lifecycles of manufactured products  
Ultimately we are reducing resource inputs, emissions 
and waste for customers in automotive, aerospace, 
construction, manufacturing, agriculture and mining, 
among other industries  Another example is Hexagon’s 
geospatial technology, which is used to monitor and 
analyse changes to our planet, providing real-time data 
on deforestation, flooding, wildfires, melting glaciers and 
other effects of changing climate for authorities, city 
planners and research institutes all over the world  
This also means that the increased need for technology 
that supports sustainability directly translates to an 
increased need for Hexagon's solutions, which is why we 
consider sustainability as our greatest growth opportunity  
Strengthening our performance on the sustainability 
side will feed directly into a stronger performance on the 
business side and vice versa, and our success in business 
is tightly linked to our contribution to sustainability  
Simply put, Hexagon’s sustainability strategy is to 
empower and create a positive ESG impact either through 
our solutions and partnerships, or through our value chain 
and people as visualised in the picture  Our goals and 
expectations are deliberately set high, and whether you 
are a valued shareholder, customer or employee, we look 
forward to sharing our journey and progress with you

Hexagon Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
In 2023, Hexagon initiated its first double materiality 
assessment to determine material topics and to be 
compliant with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting 
Directive (CSRD) standards  The double materiality 
assessment considers the social and environmental as 
well as financial impacts of the material issues, taking 
an outside-in and inside-out perspective of relevant 
opportunities and risks  
Materiality assessment methodology
The assessment consisted of three stages including:
• Due diligence preparation to identify potentially material 
topics, utilising the European Sustainability Rerporting 
Standards (ESRS) and topics defined in the CSRD, 
also including a review of Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB) sectors and peer disclosures for 
a comprehensive analysis  
• Survey, workshop and interview assessment of 
sustainability impact on the company, people and 
environment, considering both risks and opportunities  
The assessment involved internal and external 
stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, 
suppliers, customers, subject matter experts, investors 
and community groups 
• Defining the key material opportunities and risks for 
Hexagon, prioritising efforts based on assessment 
outcome and following relevant ESRS standards for 
transparent disclosure 
Materiality assessment issue pool
The issue pool of potential material topics is mapped in 
the matrix, defined under ESG  Each sub-topic is weighed 
based on its financial materiality for Hexagon and its 
impact on the environment and society  
A topic is considered as material if it is likely to affect 
Hexagon’s future cash flow, or if it has a significant impact 
on people or the environment

a key business 
opportunity
The key material topics identified through the double 
materiality assessment were climate change, own 
workforce, workers in the value chain, and business 
conduct  Each material topic is also associated with 
related material sub-topics as shown in the table 
The majority of the issues defined as highly material for 
Hexagon are primarily considered as opportunities by its 
stakeholders  Hexagon provides solutions that address 
the main environmental and social challenges that 
companies and nations face today  Furthermore, Hexagon 
recognise that some of the topics that scored lower 
and therefore have been deemed non-material, such as 
circular economy, biodiversity and land use, are relevant 
for Hexagon's future product portfolio  Embracing these 
topics as opportunities is necessary to ensure a more 
forward-thinking approach to developing future solutions  
The broad portfolio suite aiming to solve customers' 
challenges related to productivity, energy efficiency, 
data protection, climate change adaption and mitigation, 
digitalisation and more, are not positioned as threats or 
risks but rather an opening for increased profitability and 
stronger financial performance  By investing in bringing 
new tools, solutions and technologies that better meet 
the sustainability needs of its customers, Hexagon can 
continue strengthening its position as an enabler of a 
sustainable future  
The key material risk areas for Hexagon are within 
the fields of cyber security, export controls, supplier 
management and data protection, highlighting the need 
for continuous improvement and investments in strong 
compliance and governance processes  
Hexagon's material topics are clearly linked to the United 
Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs) and are 
the starting point for Hexagon's sustainability strategy  
The description of topics, their impact materiality and the 
financial materiality table can be found in the ESG notes of

Sustainability reporting
standards
Hexagon’s ESG reporting covers its own operations and 
value chain, and its goals are aligned to the company 
strategy objectives to generate value and lower risks  
Several reporting standards form the basis of the 
reporting  The climate targets go above and beyond the 
Paris Agreement goals and are submitted to the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for verification  The 
sustainability report is prepared in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and United 
Nations' Global Compact, and also take into account the 
SASB and CSRD reporting framework  
Hexagon is a signatory of the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) which means that the company 
supports and actively promotes its ten principles on the 
environment, labour practices, human rights and anti-
corruption in our operations and in relation to external 
stakeholders  This also means that Hexagon seeks to 
conduct business in a responsible and ethical manner and 
support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
To further increase transparency, Hexagon has also 
publicly submitted its climate impact data to the Carbon 
Disclosure Project (CDP)  For an overview of the ESG-
related reporting, please see page 84, Sustainability Key

Quantifying avoided emissions 
A key benefit of Hexagon’s core portfolio solutions 
is greater efficiency in processes for construction, 
manufacturing, product design and more  The efficiency 
is achieved through reduced material input, lower 
consumption of utilities and increased labour productivity  
A common result of the increased efficiency is lower 
carbon emissions, a desired outcome for almost any 
company aiming to reduce its environmental impact 
To assess its impact on enhancing customer 
sustainability, Hexagon conducted a pilot project in 2023 
utilising the BLK360 reality capture solution  The findings 
clearly showcased how Hexagon’s solutions enabled 
customers to automate their workflows, consequently 
boosting productivity and diminishing both costs and 
the environmental footprint  Specifically, in the pilot 
customer scenario, the BLK360 enabled the automation 
of modular gypsum board production, which cut 
measuring time around 50% and reduced emissions from 
both the installation process and workforce commuting  
The material waste decreased from 10 to 0 tonnes, while 
total material requirement was reduced around 1 tonne, 
measuring process time was halved from 2 70 to 1 35 
minutes, and labour hours required were cut from 18 to 
just 4 hours  This resulted in savings of 827 kgCO2-eq for an 
area of 1,479 m2 functional unit, as per avoided emissions 
guidance from > World Resources Institute  In 2024 and 
beyond, Hexagon aims to scale this approach to empower 
more customers to adopt sustainable practices and drive 
positive environmental impact across more industries

Ensuring sustainability as Hexagon grows
Acquisitions play a vital role in Hexagon’s growth strategy  
In this business model, a focus on sustainability is central 
to the company’s overall sustainability management 
as Hexagon acquires and integrates new companies  
For Hexagon, it is always a make or buy decision when 
evaluating the R&D roadmap and potential acquisition 
candidates that support Hexagon’s growth strategy  
In addition to filling gaps in the portfolio, Hexagon’s 
acquisition strategy is focused on extracting synergies 
across its different businesses and positioning the 
company for future growth opportunities  Acquisition 
candidates are regularly monitored and evaluated on 
market position, customer reputation as well as growth 
and profitability potential 
Sustainability in the due diligence process
Hexagon considers many sustainability factors in an 
acquisition process as it enables the company to make 
better investment decisions, thereby unlocking the 
potential value of sustainability and reducing the harm 
resulting from any possible limitations  It also ensures 
a valuable foundation after the transaction has been 
completed  
In Hexagon’s standard due diligence process, several 
sustainability elements are considered  These include 
a detailed review of the internal controls of the target 
company, quality business practices, human rights, 
environmental and employee matters, as well as 
compliance with ISO (International Organization for 
Standardization) standards, LEED (Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design) guidelines, anti-corruption 
regulations (FCPA, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and 
export controls  Hexagon also evaluates whether target 
companies are following a robust code of conduct and 
whether their own corporate sustainability programmes 
are effective 
The considerations and steps taken by Hexagon in a due 
diligence process are often project-specific  For example, 
when evaluating a manufacturing company, Hexagon 
evaluates whether the company takes measures to ensure 
responsible production and a sustainable supply chain  
Overall, Hexagon seeks to obtain an understanding of the 
company’s philosophy, how this has impacted operations 
and whether management can address potential issues 
in the right framework  This allows Hexagon to better 
determine the company’s sustainability profile and its 
potential fit 
Hexagon also frequently uses external specialists, 
including counsels trained in intellectual property, 
employee benefits, anti-corruption, international trade, 
antitrust, labour and employment law and real estate  
Having a cross-functional team supplemented by external 
experts allows Hexagon to appraise all key features of the 
target company, including its sustainability practices and 
suitability for integration into Hexagon as a whole

Integrating companies in Hexagon
After the closing of a transaction, where a company 
becomes legally owned and controlled by Hexagon,the 
acquired company is integrated into Hexagon’s processes 
and methods  All companies in the Group are required 
to adopt and implement the Hexagon Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics, which is based on the UN Global 
Compact’s ten principles on human rights, labour, 
environment and anti-corruption  The newly acquired 
company also implements the Hexagon Ethics and 
Compliance Programmes, covering topics including 
antitrust, anti-corruption, business ethics and export 
controls 
Hexagon also has an on-boarding checklist covering 
employment, ethics and compliance, legal issues, 
insurance, intellectual property and information 
technology  The operational integration often includes 
regular in-house visits to the acquired company to assist 
with multiple onboarding tasks including compliance 
training and financial accounting reviews 
Employment agreements are established between the 
target company and the acquiring entity, which set out 
policies regarding sick leave, equipment usage, travel 
policies and recordkeeping  In all cases, employees 
entering the Hexagon Group via an acquisition are 
informed about Hexagon’s Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics and are expected to behave consistently according 
to the Code 
Hexagon’s acquisition strategy is 
focused on extracting synergies 
across its different businesses 
and further increasing the group’s 
exposure to software and recurring 
revenues

Data privacy 
Data protection is one of the six pillars of Hexagon’s 
compliance programme and a key risk topic in Hexagon’s 
materiality analysis  Employees, customers and partners 
require assurance that their personal information will 
be handled and managed in a safe and responsible way  
Hexagon is committed to ensuring all personal information 
will be processed in accordance with global best practices 
and this is reflected in its Data Protection Compliance 
Programme (DPC Programme)  The Group Privacy and 
Information Security Officer has responsibility for 
managing and overseeing the implementation of the DPC 
Programme across Hexagon Divisions  Changes to the DPC 
Programme are reported to the Chief Compliance Officer 
and Audit Committee on a regular basis  
The DPC Programme is implemented through teams within 
each division, with responsibility for delivery managed by 
Divisional Privacy Officers  The principles of the European 
Union’s General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) are 
used as its baseline for the protection of all personal 
data, regardless of locality  GDPR is widely considered as 
the ‘gold standard’ of privacy law and provides a robust 
and reliable means to ensure personal information is 
protected appropriately  Additions have been adopted 
since 2018 to encompass other jurisdictional laws as these 
have been enacted  
Following the introduction of updated standard 
contracual clauses (SCC) by the European Union in 2021, 
Hexagon has been working to update all existing contracts 
and has revised its contracting procedures to implement 
the new SCCs in all new contracts  Under the SCCs, data 
transfers from an EU entity to a third country that does not 
provide adequate data protection can only be made after 
the appropriate risk assessment has been conducted  
Hexagon has implemented a standard process to conduct 
a suitable data transfer impact assessment (DTIA) in 
line with the legislation  Hexagon recognises that the 
protection of personal information is not a point-in-time 
process and requires committed changes to technology, 
processes and people  
All Hexagon employees are required to comply with data 
protection principles and receive training appropriate to 
their role  Employees with higher levels of responsibility 
for the protection of personal data are provided with 
advanced training and offered the opportunity to become 
certified professionals through programmes provided 
by the International Association of Privacy Professionals 
(IAPP)  
Cyber security 
Hexagon’s Group Cyber Council was established in 2019 
to provide oversight and governance over all information 
security matters  The Cyber Council is chaired by the 
Group Privacy and Information Security Officer and 
includes executive members representing all major 
areas of the Hexagon business including Operations, 
Legal, Finance and Product  The objectives of the Cyber 
Council are to ensure protection of Hexagon’s intellectual 
property, ensure the cyber resilience of its networks and 
protect Hexagon’s customers through its position in the 
supply chain  As a global leader in digital reality solutions,

Hexagon understands the imperative of security within its 
products and services  The autonomous revolution relies 
on data as fuel, and the protection and integrity of this 
data is central to Hexagon’s Innovation Process  
Hexagon continued to build and develop its employee 
awareness programme throughout 2023 and included 
training on all key topics of security  All new employees 
receive a set of baseline training courses and are then 
included in the ongoing annual programme of events  
Additionally, employees are frequently targeted by 
phishing simulations using a wide range of phish lures to 
both train and test employees on how to identify email-
based threats  Phishing simulations are run in multiple 
languages to match real-world threats as closely as 
possible  In 2023, 26,736 employees and subcontractors 
were trained in cyber security covering multiple relevant 
areas to decrease cyber security-related risks  
During 2023, Hexagon continued the delivery of its cyber-
security strategy as defined in 2022  The replacement 
of legacy technology with market-leading solutions 
ensures that its ability to detect and respond to threats 
supports business goals and objectives  Standardisation 
of technology across the security spectrum ensures that 
as the threat landscape develops, Hexagon is optimised to 
defend and respond effectively and efficiently  
Hexagon has complemented the replacement of its 
technology landscape with a major reorganisation of its 
security operation  This has enhanced both the ability to 
respond to internal requests for service as well as external 
threats and incidents  The global security organisation has 
been further augmented by the addition of an externally 
managed Security Operations Centre, monitoring all of 
Hexagon's corporate networks and resources to provide 
full 24/7 visibility of events  
Hexagon continues to back up its cyber capabilities with a 
comprehensive cyber insurance programme, to transfer 
some of the residual risk  Hexagon works with leading 
cyber insurance brokers and a consortium of underwriters 
to ensure an appropriate level of cover is provided to 
protect against data losses and business continuity 
interruption  
In 2023, 26,736 employees 
and subcontractors were 
trained in cyber security

A diverse workforce imperative for innovation 
Hexagon is committed to being a diverse workplace that 
mirrors the international nature of the business – with 
employees, customers and suppliers working across 
the world in more than 50 countries  With an approach 
focused on competence development, diversity and 
inclusion, employee engagement and health and safety, 
Hexagon is able to increase its innovativeness and 
remain competitive with its peers, regardless of where it 
operates  
As a global organisation, Hexagon celebrates the 
differences of its employees and strives to build a working 
environment where different values and perspectives are 
actively harnessed in order to create the best solutions for 
an equally diverse customer base  In promoting equity and 
inclusion, Hexagon also ensures its access to a greater 
range of talent 
The Hexagon Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
helps govern issues such as fair employment, diversity, 
discrimination, harassment, health and safety  All 
businesses in the company are obliged to adopt and 
implement the Code to ensure a uniform approach to the 
issues  All employees and contractors undergo mandatory 
training in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to 
ensure it is adopted broadly throughout the organisation, 
which is repeated regularly to ensure adherence  In 2023, 
24,695 employees were trained in the Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics  
During 2023, a global employee survey was conducted 
to capture the sentiment and evolvement areas among 
Hexagon’s workforce  The engagement level was 73% - 
the same score as for 2022  Hexagon’s 2023 engagement 
score was 2% higher than the score of general industry 
benchmark, and 6% higher than the score of the high-
technology companies benchmark  However, it was 4% 
lower than the high performing companies benchmark, 
leaving further room for improvement  Using the findings 
of the report, Hexagon has implemented action plans for 
50% of the employees participating in the survey in an 
effort to increase the engagement and retention rate  
Areas representing the rest of the workforce are currently 
under assessment to determine the best approach 
to improve opportunities for engagement and further 
growth 
In 2023, the retention rate of Hexagon was 92%, compared 
to 89% in 2022  The diversity & inclusion index, covering 
14 inclusion-related topics, was 84% which was 1% 
better compared to 2022, indicating that the culture- 
and inclusion- building activities across Hexagon are 
having a positive effect on the overall sentiment  Where 
appropriate, Hexagon supports a flexible workplace and 
A responsible culture

the opportunity to work from home, as well as flexible 
working schedules to further support inclusion 
To further improve the general awareness of relevant ESG 
topics material for Hexagon, sustainability e-learning 
sessions were offered in 2023  Through this education 
programme, Hexagon successfully managed to engage 
15,991 of employees in training sessions  
Diversity and inclusion  from recruitment to senior 
management trainings
Building a truly diverse workforce is a long-term 
commitment that requires a dedicated approach to 
diversity through the full employment cycle – from 
recruitment all the way to senior management trainings  
Hexagon aims to ensure equity and inclusive behaviour 
through the four stages of a Hexagon career; recruitment, 
early career start, career development, senior 
management  For the recruitment phase, Hexagon has 
adopted inclusive hiring practices for its job postings and 
talent pool pipeline, achieved through inclusive language 
and gender-neutral university recruiting activities  For 
the early career start phase, all Hexagon employees 
undergo the Diversity & Inclusion educational programme 
that define the rights, expectations and obligations of 
all colleagues  In 2023, the completion rate for the DEI 
trainings were 78% for all employees  For the career 
development phase, Hexagon has implemented mentoring 
programs, trainings, awareness campaigns, workshops, 
women’s leadership forums and networks of under-
represented employees to support and encourage a more 
diverse and inclusive culture and workforce  One example 
is the Hexagon women’s network Femme Like You, a 
network designed to promote equity and diversity and 
create events where employees can discuss challenges, 
pitch ideas and share best practices for building inclusive 
workplaces  Also, all senior management are provided 
with a manager toolkit workspace to provide the tools and 
knowledge necessary to lead by example  
Hexagon strives to be a diverse workplace across all 
levels of management  At year-end 2023, the Hexagon 
BoD consists of 3 women and 4 men while executive 
management consists of 1 woman and 12 men  Gender 
distribution in leading positions, including divisional 
management and their direct reports, was 24% women 
and 76% men in 2023  The goal is to reach 30% female 
managers by 2025, and Hexagon is currently implementing 
a set of initiatives for recruiting, retaining and developing 
female leaders to meet the goal by the deadline

Discrimination
Any kind of discrimination is completely unacceptable 
at Hexagon, no matter if it is exhibited internally or in 
relation to customer and supplier relations  Prohibiting 
discrimination is part of the Hexagon Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics and the Unfair Discrimination 
and Harassment Policy  To ensure that discriminatory 
behaviour does not exist within the organisation, 
employees are trained on expectations and have several 
channels to report any discriminatory behaviour  The first 
avenue for reporting is through direct access to the HR 
leader within their division  If the issue cannot be handled 
at the divisional level, the HR EVP is approached  The 
Compliance Officer also offers direct communication 
opportunities that are managed by the Corporate Legal 
Group, through the anonymous third-party whistleblowing 
system  Employees who may be subjected to unfair 
discrimination and or harassment have the right to report 
it to Hexagon, and there are processes in place to ensure 
the employee may do so without fear of victimisation and 
intimidation  In 2023, 20,315 employees were trained in the 
anti-harassment course 
Our people  transparency builds trust 
Hexagon is proud of its diverse workforce and strives 
to increase transparency in employee data to promote 
accountability and highlight improvement areas related 
to representation and equality  This is the first employee 
report including representation of both women and men 
at different job levels globally, and also of ethnic groups in 
the US following local legal guidelines  Hexagon’s ambition 
is to further support initiatives that foster an inclusive 
culture that increases its competitiveness as an employer, 
where all employees have same opportunities to grow and 
prosper 
In promoting equity and 
inclusion, Hexagon also 
ensures its access to a 
greater range of talent

the renewable energy ratio in total energy consumption was 
46%, and the target will be reached and secured by investing 
in solar panels at its sites and to purchase renewable energy 
certificates (RECs)  The share of electric vehicles in the 
car fleet was 8% in 2023, and a company car policy will be 
adopted to ensure combustion engine vehicles will be phased 
out as the leasing contracts are renewed  
Highlight achievements in 2023 includes:
• Increased share of purchased or produced renewable 
electricity out of total electricity to 46%, compared to 42% 
in 2022 
• Increased purchase of renewable energy certificates by 
60% compared to 2022 
• Increased total renewable energy produced by 35% 
compared to 2022 
• Doubled the share of electric vehicles in total vehicle fleet 
Facility improvement programme 
Hexagon facilities have started an improvement 
programme seeking to boost their resource efficiency to 
reduce their impact on the environment  Many facilities 
reduced their power consumption in 2023 compared 
to 2022, despite an increase in production  At the same 
time, Hexagon increased its total installed capacity of 
renewable energy production with photovoltaic energy 
and managed to increase the renewable energy produced 
to ~34’800 MWh (35% increase compared to 2022)  
To ensure reduction of its Scope 2 emissions, Hexagon 
entered into a green power purchase agreement (PPA) 
for its major facilities  Furthermore, Hexagon covers the 
demand for renewable electricity in areas where direct 
access to renewable energy sources is not feasible via 
the purchase of RECs in order to stimulate investment in 
renewable energy projects  
Hexagon has also obtained ISO 14001 certifications 
for the majority of its production sites  On these as 
well as on other sites, environmental management 
is approached systematically and with a focus on 
continuous improvement  More information on Hexagon’s

Sustainability considerations in the design process 
When developing new products, a robust design phase is 
critical to ensure that sustainability considerations are 
encompassing all products throughout their life cycles  
New solutions are leveraged through Hexagon’s Innovation 
Process (HIP), a process that drives the efficiency 
and effectiveness of products (hardware, software 
or services) through continuous development and 
improvement  In addition to quality and cost management, 
ESG criteria were implemented in the process to increase 
transparency and enable product development teams 
to consider the environmental impact of the alternatives 
while they prototype a new/upgraded solution  The 
process includes conducting lifecycle assessments 
(LCAs) of targeted products, assessment of improvement 
potentials and assessment of these alternatives during 
product development  The LCAs include assessing the 
materials water usage, land usage and effects on climate 
change together with logistics, manufacturing, usage and 
end-of-life scenarios  The ambition is to also include data 
on the components from suppliers to understand the full 
cradle-to-gate environmental impact of each product 
to support decision-making and drive sales  To ensure 
that the HIP is properly leveraged across Hexagon, the 
company provided training to 42 of its key R&D engineers 
that are involved in the early-stage prototyping of 
hardware products  A dedicated employee is supporting 
the process to find environmental hotspots in hardware 
design and iterate improvement alternatives  As part of 
the Hexagon Innovation Process, each product group 
within Geosystems receives a recycling passport, which 
reviews materials used while it confirms that each product 
complies with the EU Directives on Waste Electrical and 
Electronic Equipment (WEEE 2012/19/EU) and Restriction 
of the use of certain hazardous substances (2011/65/EU)  
The recycling passport gives information on the product 
groups’ reusability, recyclability, treatment, and waste 
disposal 
Ethical development of artificial intelligence (AI) 
software 
Hexagon realises that development of AI-driven 
technology that optimises and enriches data to prepare 
organisations for machine learning and to empower 
autonomous operations is not only associated with 
opportunities but also with risks  To ensure the AI-driven 
solutions generate value for customers and society at 
large and to avoid unexpected negative effects from the 
software development, Hexagon has defined four key 
principles that encompass its innovation and production 
of artificial intelligence software: 1  Technology augments what people do  it does not 
replace them 
2  System data is owned by Hexagon's customers, adheres 
to local laws and respects citizens’ right to privacy 
3  Algorithms and output are transparent, explainable and 
interpretable 
4  Actionable results facilitate fair and inclusive 
decision-making 
As Hexagon’s innovation activities for artificial intelligence 
software adheres to the four principles, the company can 
certify that the use of its solutions will provide positive 
outcomes for its customers while also avoiding legal or 
commercial risks  
Minimising carbon emissions from cloud storage 
A significant part of Hexagon’s business is software-
related, meaning that a large share of the company’s 
total carbon emissions is related to the operations of the 
cloud computing and storage at its providers and internal 
servers  To reduce its cloud waste, which refers to the 
unnecessary consumption of cloud resources leading 
to higher costs without providing significant benefits or 
value, Hexagon initiated a project with one of its major 
cloud providers during 2023  The purpose is to map and 
decrease its unnecessary emissions through purchasing 
server capacity hosted with green energy and to more 
efficiently utilise the available server computing and 
storage resources  Preliminary results from 2023 indicate 
a decrease of 40 5 metric CO2eq tonnes, of which 38 2 
metric CO2eq tonnes was saved due to renewable energy 
purchases and 2 3 metric CO2eq tonnes were due to 
cloud efficiences compared to on-premises equivalent 
workloads  Since its implementation, Hexagon tracks its 
related cloud emissions on a monthly basis The final effects 
and outcomes of the project will be presented in 2024  
Occupational health and safety
The safety of personnel in the workplace is a top priority 
for Hexagon  Ensuring that employees work in a safe and 
healthy environment is the key to any successful business  
Hexagon aims to provide a workplace that is free of 
incidents and promotes a culture of hazard identification 
and awareness, near-misses and incident reporting and 
self accountability  Where appropriate, Hexagon supports 
a flexible workplace and the opportunity to work from 
home  Hexagon is responsible for maintaining a safe work 
environment by implementing all applicable health and 
safety rules and practices within each Hexagon entity  
Employees are provided with appropriate training and 
safety equipment to perform their jobs securely  Each 
employee is personally responsible for working in a safe 
manner, following all health and safety policies and 
procedures, participating in safety training and identifying 
and reporting any health and safety issues and hazards 
to management or the relevant internal stakeholders  In 
2023, the number of work-related injuries was 31 
80

Supplier requirements and audits
Hexagon’s compliance policies regarding supply chain 
management are set out in the Supplier Code of Conduct 
and in various Compliance Programme manuals and 
procedures  Hexagon selects suppliers based on an 
assessment of the overall competitiveness of the offering 
and if they live up to the goals and values expressed in 
the United Nations Global Compact’s ten principles in 
the areas of human rights, labour rights, environmental 
impact and anti-corruption  Compliance with the Supplier 
Code of Conduct, or other agreed equivalent standard, 
is a mandatory qualifying condition for Hexagon to enter 
a business relationship with a supplier  In addition, third-
party suppliers and subcontractors in Hexagon’s global 
supply chain are contractually required to meet these 
obligations  The Hexagon policies related to supply chain 
management include requirements for: 1  screening Hexagon suppliers against applicable 
sanctions list
2  conducting additional due diligence on suppliers that may 
be developing Hexagon business
3  appropriate anticorruption and other compliance 
provisions in supplier agreements
4  prohibiting acceptance of items of value or other benefits 
while knowing or suspecting that it is offered or provided 
with an expectation that a business advantage will be 
provided by Hexagon
In 2023, Hexagon successfully reached its target of 
conducting sustainability supplier audits on 100% of its 
key suppliers in risk areas  The purpose of the supplier 
audit target was to ensure that the suppliers live up to the 
expectation on environmental stewardship of Hexagon 
and to prevent any forced labor, child labour or human 
trafficking within the value chain  During the year, Hexagon 
performed approximately 116 audits of new and existing 
suppliers, of which 45 audits were of suppliers in risk 
areas  Risk areas were considered as areas defined by 
the United Nations Environment Programme Finance 
Initiative (UNEPFI) and Transparency International which 
consider both environmental and social risks  The total 
number of suppliers in risk areas are 93, and all have been 
audited in the past three years  During 2023, 3 major non-
conformances were found in the audits, none of which 
violated any local or international laws but where corrective 
measures are expected by Hexagon  All 3 major non-
conformances cases were cases of suppliers who did not 
perform supplier due diligence in their own supply chain  All 
open non-conformances are expected to be solved in 2024  
When existing suppliers fail to comply with Hexagon’s 
compliance requirements, Hexagon engages with the 
supplier and conducts an impact assessment to understand 
the root cause  Appropriate follow-up actions consist of 
taking suitable actions to ensure that the issue will not be 
repeated  Should infringements be deemed significant 
and intentional, Hexagon will terminate the supplier 
contract and seek a sourcing alternative  Key suppliers 
of manufacturing entities are evaluated through internal 
formal visits, reviews and evaluations to ensure that they 
strictly follow the Hexagon Supplier Code of Conduct  Third 
party assessment is used in cases where an issue cannot be 
verified directly with the supplier  In 2023, 39 ESG supplier 
audits were conducted on-site, 73 were conducted through 
self-assessment questionnaires, and 4 were conducted 
through third-party auditors  
Conflict minerals compliance
A small part of Hexagon’s activities is affected by the 
regulation of conflict minerals including the Dodd Frank 
Act  Hexagon does not source conflict minerals directly, 
but some divisions are indirectly affected by regulations 
due to sourcing products and materials from suppliers 
and sub-suppliers  In such cases Hexagon works in close 
collaboration with the suppliers and apply a rigorous 
process to collect all necessary data as proof of compliance  
Hexagon maintains a Conflict Minerals Policy outlining the 
commitment and actions taken to avoid conflict minerals in 
its value chain  Hexagon’s divisions implement processes 
to ensure compliance with this policy as is applicable to 
each division’s operations  For example, the Autonomy & 
Positioning division requests current and new suppliers to 
complete a Conflict Mineral Report Template (CMRT) for all 
parts  The CMRT has been provided by Responsible Minerals 
Initiative (RMI) and has been adopted by the industry  The 
CMRT file is constantly being revised by RMI with updated 
Smelter information and whenever a supplier response 
is received the file automatically identifies suspected 
Smelters  Hexagon, to best of its knowledge, represents 
and certifies that it does not source or receive any minerals, 
materials or products containing cassiterite (tin), coltan 
(tantalum), wolframite (tungsten) or gold (known as “3TG 
minerals”) at all sourced from the Democratic Republic of 
Congo or adjoining countries

EU Taxonomy
This is the third EU Taxonomy report by Hexagon  Hexagon deems 
its Taxonomy eligible revenue for 2023 to be approximately 6 33 % 
of its total turnover  While being an enabler of sustainability, the 
significant majority of Hexagon’s business activities are currently 
not defined in the EU Taxonomy and therefore will not be eligible 
with the screening criteria  Hexagon applied the precautionary 
principle to determine applicable eligible activities and excluded 
activities not clearly defined in the EU Taxonomy

Hexagon used the EU delegated acts information to determine its 
eligible activities  Of the total 2023 revenue, 6 33% is eligible and 
0 05% is aligned with the criteria defined in EU Taxonomy  Hexagon 
has interpreted its relevance in the EU Taxonomy into the following 
sections under Climate change mitigation, Climate change adapta-
tion, Circular Economy, Biodiversity and Water:
• Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology
• Infrastructure enabling road transport and public transport
• Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions
• Provision of IT/OT data-driven solutions
• Emergency Services
• Manufacture, installation and associated services for leakage 
control technologies enabling leakage reduction and prevention 
in water supply systems 
• Conservation, including restoration, of habitats[1], ecosystems[2] 
and species
• Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing
The eligible economic activity “Electricity generation using solar 
photovaltaic technology” are associated with the Archidona solar 
park Hexagon acquired and operated during 2021  
The eligible economic activity “Infrastructure enabling road trans-
port and public transport” are associated with isolated activities 
related to Hexagon’s professional surveying and mapping services  
The eligible economic activity “Data-driven solutions for GHG emis-
sions reductions” are associated with isolated activities related to 
Hexagon’s applied solutions for eMobility and windfarm enginer-
ings services, as well as the optimiser feature for the MineOperate 
solution  
The eligible economic activity “Provision of IT/OT data-driven solu-
tions” are associated with solutions related to Hexagon’s solutions 
suite at Intergraph Smart Construction, iConstruct, EAM, SDx, PAS 
and Jovix  
The eligible economic activity “Emergency services” are associated 
with isolated features related to Hexagon’s OnCall solutions suite  
The eligible economic activity “Manufacture, installation and asso-
ciated services for leakage control technologies enabling leakage 
reduction and prevention in water supply systems” are associated 
with the HxGN Networks solutions suite  
The eligible economic activity "Conservation, including restoration, 
of habitats[1], ecosystems[2] and species" are associated with inia-
tives to protect seagrass and salt marsh habitats  
The eligible economic activity “Repair, refurbishment and reman-
ufacturing of electronic and optical products” are associated with 
Hexagon’s Certified Pre-Owned Equipment Center  
Alignment: 
The activity 4 1 Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic tech-
nology (the Archidona solar park) fulfils the EU Taxonomy criteria 
for alignment as it has substantial contribution to climate mitiga-
tion, meets the criteria for climate adaptation, biodiversity and 
circular economy set forth in Appendix A and D and also meets the 
criteria of the Minimum Safeguards set forth in the EU Taxonomy, 
as it has established processes and policies for due diligence of 
Human Rights, Corruption, Taxation and Fair Competition based on 
the EU Guiding Principles 
The remaining eligible activities are not considered aligned as 
they do not meet the technical screening criteria set forth in the 
Delegated Act (2021) 2800 and (2023)2486  While the activities 
support climate change adaptation, mitigation, circular economy, 
biodiversity and water and do no significant harm to the other 
environmental goals, there is currently not enough data available 
to fully comply with all technical screening criteria set forth in the 
Delegated Act (2021) 2800 and (2023)2486  
Definitions: 
• The total turnover corresponds to Net sales in the consolidated 
income statement in the Hexagon 2023 Annual Report  The turn-
over KPI represents the proportion of the turnover derived from 
products or services that are taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy 
aligned  The taxonomy-eligible activities were screened for asso-
ciated turnover  Turnover is derived from sale of products and 
the provision of services after deducting sales rebates and value 
added tax and other taxes directly linked to turnover  Hexagon 
revenue streams stem from the sales of information technol-
ogy solutions in which hardware and software are integrated as 
well as services, licenses and other assignments  Revenue from 
agreements with customers is reported in the income statement 
as Net sales  
• CapEx is defined as investments in intangible assets excluding 
goodwill and tangible assets such as property, machinery and 
other equipment, together with the IFRS 16 right of use assets  
The total CapEx amount can be found in the Hexagon 2023 
Annual Report in notes 14-16  The CapEx KPI represents the 
proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is taxon-
omy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned  The taxonomy-eligible activ-
ities were screened for associated CapEx using cost types  The 
taxonomy-aligned CapEx investments mainly consists of intangi-
ble assets  Own measures and purchased output from suppliers' 
economic activities have not been screened for eligibility in 2023  
• OpEx is defined as direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day 
servicing of assets of the property, plant, and equipment that 
are necessary to ensure the continued and effective use of such 
assets (e g , research and development, building renovation 
measures, short-term lease, maintenance, and repair)  The OpEx 
KPI represents the proportion of the operating expenditure of 
an activity that is taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy aligned  The 
taxonomy-eligible activities were screened for associated OpEx 
using cost types  Own measures and purchased output from sup-
pliers' economic activities have not been screened for eligibility 
in 2023  
• The allocation of the turnover for eligible activities was prepared 
by using product accounts  CapEx and OpEx were allocated by 
using cost types  All activities were isolated when allocating turn-
over, CapEx and OpEx to avoid double counting

Auditor’s report on the statutory 
sustainability report
To the general meeting of the shareholders in Hexagon AB (publ), 
corporate identity number 556190-4771
Engagement and responsibility
It is the board of directors who is responsible for the statutory sus-
tainability report for the year 2023 on pages 50-89 and that it has 
been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act 
The scope of the audit
Our examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR’s 
auditing standard RevR 12 The auditor’s opinion regarding the stat-
utory sustainability report  This means that our examination of the 
statutory sustainability report is substantially different and less in 
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards 
in Sweden  We believe that the examination has provided us with 
sufficient basis for our opinion  
Opinion
A statutory sustainability report has been prepared

Notes
NOTE 1 Accounting policies
The consolidated accounts of Hexagon have been prepared in 
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS)issued by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB) and interpretation statements by the International IFRS 
Interpretation Committee (IFRIC), which have been approved by the 
European Commission for application within the EU 
Furthermore, the recommendation RFR 1 Supplementary account-
ing rules for corporate groups issued by the Swedish Financial 
Reporting Board have been applied 
The Parent Company applies the Annual Accounts Act and the 
recommendation RFR 2 Accounting for legal entities  The rec-
ommendation means that the Parent Company applies the same 
accounting policies as the Group, except in those cases when the 
Annual Accounts Act or current tax rules limits the opportunities to 
apply IFRS  Differences between the accounting principles applied 
by the Parent Company and the Group are outlined under Account-
ing Policies in the Parent Company on the next page 
The accounting policies and calculation methods applied by the 
Group are consistent with those of the previous financial year 
except as below 
On 26 March 2024, the Board of Directors and the President and 
CEO approved this annual report and consolidated accounts for 
publication and they will be presented to the Annual General 
Meeting on 29 April 2024 for adoption 
Application of new and amended standards from 2023 
New changes in standards and interpretations that entered 
into force from 1 January 2023 are not expected to have had any 
material impact on the financial statements of Hexagon 
The group has applied the temporary exception issued by the 
IASB in May 2023 from the accounting requirements for deferred 
taxes in IAS 12  Accordingly, the group neither recognises nor 
disclosures information about deferred tax assets and liabilities 
related to Pillar Two income taxes 
Application of new standards from 2024
New standards, amended standards and interpretations that 
have not entered into force, have not been applied in advance in 
the financial reports of Hexagon and are not expected to have 
any material impact on the financial statements of Hexagon 
Basis of reporting for the Parent Company and the Group
The functional currency of the Parent Company is EUR as is the 
presentation currency for the Parent Company and the Group  
The financial reports are presented in EUR  All amounts, unless 
indicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest million with 
one decimal 
Assets and liabilities are reported at historical cost except for 
certain financial instruments which are reported at fair value 
Receivables and liabilities or income and expenses are only off-
set if required or explicitly permitted by an accounting standard  
Preparing the financial statements in compliance with IFRS 
requires that Management make judgements and estimates as 
well as make assumptions that affect the application of account-
ing principles and the amounts recognised as assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses  The actual outcome may diverge from 
these estimates and assumptions  Estimates and assumptions 
are reviewed continuously  Changes of estimates are recognised 
in the period when the change is made if the change only affects 
current period or in that period when the change is made and 
coming periods if the change affects both current period and 
coming periods 
Judgements made by Management for the application of IFRS 
that have a substantial impact on the financial reports and esti-
mates made that may lead to significant adjustments in coming 
years’ financial reports are described in more detail in Note 2  
Classification
Fixed assets and long-term liabilities essentially consist of 
amounts expected to be realised or settled after twelve months 
from the balance sheet date  Current assets and short-term 
liabilities essentially consist only of amounts expected to be 
realised or settled within twelve months from the balance sheet 
date  The Group’s operating cycle is assessed to be less than one 
year 
Consolidated financial statements
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the Parent 
Company and the other companies in which the Parent Company 
has a controlling influence, that is, is exposed or has right to 
variable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect 
those returns through its involvement 
Companies or businesses acquired (acquisitions) are accounted 
for under the purchase method  The method involves a business 
combination to be regarded as a transaction in which the Group indi-
rectly acquires the assets of the business and assumes its liabilities  
The Group’s acquisition cost is determined through a purchase price 
allocation in connection with the acquisition  The acquisition cost 
is the sum of the fair value at the acquisition date of what is paid in 
cash, assumed liabilities or issue of own shares 
Contingent considerations are often conditional by future goals 
on sales or performance  At acquisition date, an estimation of the 
fulfilment of the goals is made  The contingent consideration is 
measured at fair value and included in the acquisition cost and 
recognised as a financial liability in accordance with IFRS  Long-
term contingent considerations are discounted to present value  
The measurement to fair value is initially based on the expected 
outcome of the acquired company’s sales or performance  Contin-
gent considerations are subsequently measured at fair value and 
essential effects of remeasurements are recognised in the income 
statement in accordance with IFRS  If a revenue is recognised as 
a consequence of a change in estimation, the surplus values from 
the acquisition will be tested for impairment  If the impairment test 
results in an impairment, the expense will meet the revenue from 
the remeasurement of the contingent consideration  Transaction 
costs are expensed in the income statement when incurred 
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are rec-
ognised initially at their fair values at the acquisition date  Excep-
tions are made for acquired tax assets and liabilities, employee 
benefits, stock-based compensation and assets held for sale, 
valued in accordance with the principles described for each item 
in in each standard 
98
In brief Financial plan Board of Directors’ report Corporate governance report Compliance Sustainability report Financial reports Additional information
Hexagon Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
Goodwill recorded represents the difference between the acqui-
sition cost of group companies’ shares, the value of non-con-
trolling interest in the acquired business and the fair value of 
previously owned shares and on the other hand, the purchase 
price allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  
For goodwill disclosures, see Note 14 Intangible fixed assets  
Non-controlling interests are recognised at the acquisition date, 
either at its fair value or at its proportionate share of the carrying 
value of the acquires identifiable assets and liabilities  Acqui-
sition of non-controlling interest is reported as transactions 
between shareholders, i e  within equity 
Group companies’ financial statements are included in the con-
solidated accounts as of the date when control occurs (acquisi-
tion date) until the control ceases  
When control of the Group company ceases, but the Group 
retains shares in the company, remaining shares are initially 
reported at fair value  The gain or loss from remeasurement is 
recorded in the income statement 
Translation of financial reports to EUR
Assets and liabilities in operations with a functional currency 
other than EUR are translated at the closing day exchange rate 
and income statements are translated at average exchange 
rates for the period  The resulting translation differences are 
recognised directly in other comprehensive income  The amount 
is recognised separately as a translation reserve in equity  In 
case of divestment of an operation with a functional currency 
other than EUR the accumulated translation differences related 
to the divested operation are reclassified from equity to income 
statement at the time of recognition of capital gain or loss from 
the divestment 
Monetary long-term items towards businesses with a functional 
currency other than EUR, for which settlement is not planned or 
will probably not occur within the foreseeable future, are part 
of the company’s net investment  Translation differences on 
such monetary items, which comprise part of the company’s net 
investment are recognised in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the translation reserve in equity 
Transactions, assets and liabilities other currencies than EUR
Transactions in non-EUR currencies are recognised in the func-
tional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction day  
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional 
currency on the closing day at the exchange rate then in effect  
Exchange rate differences that arise through these translations 
are recognised in the income statement 
Eliminated transactions
Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue or expenses and 
gains or losses that arise from transactions between group com-
panies are eliminated in their entirety in the preparation of the 
consolidated accounts  Losses are eliminated in the same way as 
gains, but only to the extent that there is no impairment loss 
Earnings per share
The calculation of earnings per share is based on net earnings 
attributable to the Parent Company shareholders and on the 
weighted number of shares outstanding during the year  The cal-
culation of earnings per share after dilution takes into account 
the quarterly calculated dilutive effect from any potential com-
mon shares 
Accounting policies in the Parent Company
The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as 
the Group with the following deviations:
• In the Parent Company, the exemption in RFR 2 for IFRS 9 Finan-
cial Instruments is applied  This means, among other things, that 
financial instruments are valued based on acquisition value and 
the principles of impairment testing of loss risk provisions in 
IFRS 9 are applied to the Parent Company’s short-term receiv-
ables and financial fixed assets 
• In the Parent Company, the exemption in RFR 2 for IFRS 16 
Leasing Agreements is applied and the costs for all leasing 
agreements are reported on a straight-line basis over the leasing 
period 
• In the Parent Company participations in group companies are 
reported at acquisition value less any impairment 
• Acquisition value of shares in subsidiaries includes transaction 
costs and contingent consideration 
• Non-monetary assets acquired in a currency other than EUR are 
reported at historical exchange rates  Other assets and liabilities 
in currencies other than EUR are reported at the exchange rate 
on the balance sheet date 
• The Parent Company applies the alternative rule for group contri-
butions and reports both submitted and received group contribu-
tions and appropriations in the income statement 
Dividends
The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors reduces earn-
ings available for distribution and is recognised as a liability when 
the Annual General Meeting has approved the dividend 
Approval of accounts
The Parent Company’s and the consolidated financial state-
ments will be presented to the Annual General Meeting for adop-
tion on 29 April 2024

NOTE 2 Critical accounting estimates 
and assumptions
The critical accounting estimates and assumptions that are 
addressed in this section are those that Company Management 
and the Board of Directors regard as the most important for 
understanding Hexagon’s financial reporting  The information 
is limited to areas that are significant considering the degree 
of impact and underlying uncertainty  Hexagon’s accounting 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience 
and assumptions that company management and the Board of 
Directors regard as reasonable under the current circumstances  
The conclusions based on these accounting estimates constitute 
the foundation for the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, 
in the event that they cannot be established through information 
from other sources  The actual outcome may differ from these 
accounting estimates and assumptions 
Customer contracts
Parts of Hexagon’s sales derive from major and complex cus-
tomer contracts  The critical estimates of customer contracts 
include establishing the amounts that are to be recognised as 
income and when the income should be recognised  For example, 
company management makes estimates of completed perfor-
mance in relation to the contractual terms and conditions, the 
estimated total contractual costs and the proportion of the 
contract that has been completed at a certain point in time  The 
degree of completion is established by setting incurred cost in 
relation to total costs required to complete the contract  The 
estimations are also base for any loss provision, if any 
Hexagon also enters into revenue agreements that contain mul-
tiple elements, such as hardware, software and or services  For 
these agreements, Hexagon need to assess if revenue should 
be allocated to each element as different accounting principles 
apply for these elements 
Intangible assets
Intangible assets within Hexagon concern essentially pertain to 
goodwill, trademarks and other assets as a result of acquisition, 
such as customer relationships and technology  Goodwill and 
other acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life are not 
subject to annual amortisation, while other intangible assets 
are amortised  Insofar as the underlying operations develop 
negatively, an impairment requirement may arise  Impairment 
test is implemented if necessary, but at least once a year  Such 
intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing, 
which is essentially based on the value in use, making assump-
tions about the sales trend, the Group’s profit margins, on-going 
investments, changes in working capital and discount interest 
rate  Company management considers the assumptions applied 
to be compatible with the data received from external sources of 
information or from previous experience  Hexagon’s goodwill on 
31 December amounted to 9,616 6 MEUR (9,599 5)  Other intan-
gible assets not subject to amortisation amount to 1,073 9MEUR 
(1,060 4) as of this date  Performed impairment tests demon-
strate that reported values are defendable 
Tax assets and liabilities
The Board of Directors and Company Management continuously 
assess the carrying amount of both current and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities  For deferred tax assets, Hexagon has to 
assess the probability of whether it will be possible to utilise the 
deductible temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax 
assets to offset future taxable profits  In addition, in certain sit-
uations, the value of the deferred tax assets and liabilities may 
be uncertain due to ongoing tax processes, for example  Accord-
ingly, the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may deviate 
from these estimates due to a change in future earning capacity, 
changed tax regulations or the outcome of examinations by 
authorities or tax courts of issued or not yet issued tax returns  
When assessing the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities, 
Hexagon has to form an opinion of the tax rate that will apply at 
the time of the reversal of the temporary differences  Hexagon 
recognised deferred tax liabilities, net in an amount of 400 7 
MEUR (459 5) net, at the end of 2023  At the same date, the Group 
had tax-loss carry-forwards with a value of 42 6 MEUR (49 7) that 
were not recognised as assets  These assets could not be cap-
italised based on assessments of the opportunity to utilise the 
tax deficits  In comparison with the final outcome, the estimates 
made concerning both deferred tax assets and liabilities could 
have either a positive or a negative impact on earnings 
Pension obligations
Within Hexagon, there are defined-benefit pension schemes 
based on significant assumptions concerning future benefits 
pertaining to either the current or prior workforce  Pension obli-
gations amounted to 52 7 MEUR (48 2) at the end of 2023  When 
calculating the pension liability, a number of actuarial assump-
tions are of major significance to the outcome of the calculation  
The most critical pertain to the discount interest rate on the 
obligation, the rate of pay increases, employee turnover and esti-
mated length of life  A reduced discount interest rate increases 
the recognised pension liability  The actual outcome could devi-
ate from the recognised amount if the applied assumptions prove 
to be wrong 
Business combination
Hexagon acquire companies on a continuous basis  In connection 
with the acquisitions, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are 
valued to fair value in a purchase price allocation analysis  The 
valuation is to a certain extent based on management assess-
ment of the future earnings of the acquired company  Many of 
the acquisition deals contain contingent consideration which 
is based on the outcome of the acquired company earnings for 
a predetermined period  The fair value of contingent consider-
ations recognised as a liability is reviewed on a regular basis, 
which requires management to assess the future performance of 
the acquired company  An inaccurate assessment of this might 
result in overstated acquired assets or liabilities for contingent 
considerations

NOTE 3 Segment reporting 
Hexagon’s Board of Directors is responsible for determining the 
Group’s overall objectives, developing and monitoring the over-
all strategy, decisions on major acquisitions, divestments and 
investments and ongoing monitoring of operations 
The President is responsible for leading and controlling Hexagon’s 
operations in accordance with the strategy determined by the 
Board  The President is therefore the Group’s chief operating 
decision maker (CODM) and is the function that internally within 
the Hexagon Group allocates resources and evaluates results  The 
Group’s chief operating decision maker assesses the performance 
in the operating segments based on earnings before financial 
items and adjustments  Financial items and taxes are reported for 
the Group as a whole 
Hexagon’s operations are organised, governed and reported 
based on the two operating segments Geospatial Enterprise 
Solutions and Industrial Enterprise solutions  The operating seg-
ment Geospatial Enterprise Solutions has sensors for capturing 
data from land and air as well as sensors for positioning via sat-
ellites  The sensors are complemented by software (GIS) for cre-
ation of 3D maps and models, which are used for decision-making 
in a range of software applications, covering areas such as sur-
veying, construction, public safety and agriculture  The operating 
segment Industrial Enterprise Solutions provides metrology 
systems that incorporate the latest in sensor technology for fast 
and accurate measurements, as well as CAD (computer aided 
design) and CAM (computer aided manufacturing) software  The 
solutions within this segment optimise design, processes and 
throughput in manufacturing facilities and create and leverage 
asset management information critical to the planning, con-
struction and operation of plants and process facilities in a num-
ber of industries such as automotive, aerospace and oil and gas 
The two segments have separate product offerings and customer 
groups and hence differentiated risk composition  There is mar-
ginal sales between the two operating segments  Both segments 
are applying the same accounting principles as the Group  Hexa-
gon’s internal reporting, representing the base for detailed review 
and analysis, is designed in alignment with the described division 
into operating segments  Sales within each operating segment are 
additionally analysed geographically  
From 2024 Hexagon will change its segments reporting and report 
revenues and adjusted operating earnings (EBIT1) for the operating 
divisions Manufacturing Intelligence, Asset Lifecycle Intelligence, 
Geosystems, Autonomous Solutions and Safety, Infrastructure & 
Geospatial

Of the Parent Company’s net sales, 100 per cent (100) refers to 
sales to other group companies  Of the year’s purchases in the 
Parent Company, 81 per cent (72) refers to purchases from group 
companies 
NOTE 5 Revenue from contracts with 
customers
Hexagon sells information technology solutions in which hard-
ware and software are integrated as well as services, licenses 
and other assignments  Revenue from agreements with custom-
ers is reported in the income statement as net sales 
Sale of goods
Revenue is recognised when control of the good is transferred 
to the customer, which coincide with the good being delivered to 
the customer and Hexagon has objective evidence that the cus-
tomer will approve the good  The amount of the revenue will equal 
the consideration stated in the contract minus rebates  There is 
no financing component in the contract as the expected credit do 
not exceed one year  The Group’s obligation to offer a repayment 
for defected goods in accordance with standard warranty terms, 
is accounted for as a provision, see Note 23 
Sale of services, licenses and other assignments
Parts of contracts with customers not being sale of goods com-
pose sale of installations, service, training, licenses and software 
subscriptions 
Revenue from sale of services such as installations, services 
and training are recognised in the period when the services are 
performed  Licenses are classified either as a license that gives 
right to use the underlying immaterial asset as it is constituted 
at the issuing of the license (right-to-use) or as a license that 
gives right to access the underlying intangible asset during the 
license period (right-to-access)  Revenue from sale of right-to-
use licenses is recognised when the license is transferred to the 
customer  Revenue from sale of right-to-access licenses is rec-
ognised during the license period  Revenue from sale of software 
subscriptions is recognised straight-line as the performance 
obligation is fulfilled, during the subscription period  
Revenue from contracts where there is no alternative use of 
Hexagon’s performance and where Hexagon has right to cost 
compensation if the customer cancels the contract is recognised 
over time  The degree of completion is determined by comparing 
the expenditure that has arisen in relation to the total estimated 
expenditure for the assignment  If the degree of completion can-
not be reliably determined, only those amounts corresponding 
to the expenditure that has arisen are recognised as revenue, 
but only to the extent that it is likely that they will be remuner-
ated by the buyer  If it appears likely that all the expenditure for 
an assignment will exceed total revenue, the probable loss is 
accounted immediately and fully, as an expense 
Some contracts contain several performance obligations  A per-
formance obligation that does not contain an integration service 
with the other obligations in the contract, does not lead to a sig-
nificant modification or adaptation of the other obligations in the 
contract and that is not strongly dependent on or integrated with 
the other obligations in the contract is distinct and represents a 
separate performance obligation  The transaction price of the 
contract is allocated to the separate performance obligations 
according to their stand-alone selling prices  Revenue from 
each performance obligation is recognised as the obligation 
has been fulfilled 
Estimation of revenue, cost and degree of completion is being 
revised if conditions change  Changes in estimations is rec-
ognised in the income statement in the period when the Execu-
tive Leadership has knowledge of the circumstances causing the 
change 
In fixed price contracts, the customers pay a fixed price 
according to an agreed payment plan  If the value of the services 
performed by Hexagon exceeds the payments, a contract asset 
will be recognised  If the payments exceed the value of the 
performed services, a contract liability will be recognised 
If the contract contains a fee per hour, revenue is recognised to 
the extent Hexagon has right to invoice the customer  Customers 
are invoiced on a monthly basis and right to consideration exists 
when the invoice has been generated 
Main part of recognised revenue reflects performance obliga-
tions fulfilled during current year  The performance obligations 
are usually fulfilled within 12 months, why disclosure about trans-
action price allocated to the remaining performance obligations 
is exempted 
Contract costs
Additional costs to obtain a contract are recognised as an asset if 
the Group expects to recover those costs  If time of depreciation 
of the asset that would have been recognised is below one year, 
the additional costs are recognised as cost when they occur 
Financing component
The Group does not expect any material contracts with custom-
ers where the period between transferring of goods and services 
to the customer and payment from the customer exceeds one 
year  As a consequence of this, the Group does not adjust trans-
action prices for time value of money

1) Comprises brands 
2) Comprises capitalised development costs, patents, technology and other intangible assets, which are amortised linearly based on estimated useful life
Hexagon performed its annual impairment test for goodwill and 
other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth 
quarter 2023 and tested if the carrying value of the CGU’s exceed 
their recoverable value  The recoverable value is the higher of 
the units net realisable value and value in use, which is the dis-
counted present value of future cash flows  
Calculation of recoverable value
The recoverable values of the cash-generating units consist of its 
value in use  The utilisation values are calculated using cash flow 
forecasts based on budgets approved by the management that 
extend over a period of five years  The after-tax discount rates 
applied to cash flow forecasts are shown in the table below  The 
annual growth rate for extrapolating cash flows beyond the five-
year period was 2 0 per cent (2 0) for all cash-generating units  
Annual growth is a conservative assessment and is set equal to 
expected inflation  The result of a write-down test has resulted 
in the management not identifying any write-down need for any 
cash-generating unit

Key assumptions
The calculation of value in use for all CGU is most sensitive to the 
following assumptions:
• Forecasts, including operating margins and sales growth
• Discount rates • Growth rates used to extrapolate cash flow beyond the 
forecast period 
Forecasts
Projected cash flows, approved by management, is based on 
an analysis of historic performance as well as a best estimation 
regarding the future  Hexagon has since 2001 mainly shown rising 
operating margins and virtually continuous good organic growth  
The operating margins are based on average values achieved 
historically  The margins are increased over the period to reflect 
anticipated efficiency improvements  The organic growth is 
based on an analysis of how the competition situation is judged 
to develop over time 
Discount rates
Discount rates represent the current market assessment of the 
risks specific to respective CGU, taking into consideration the 
time value of money as well as individual risks  The discount rate 
calculation is based on the specific circumstances of respective 
CGU and is derived from its weighted average cost of capital 
(WACC)  The WACC considers both debt and equity  The cost of 
equity is derived from the expected return on investment by the 
Group investors  The cost of debt is based on the interest bearing 
borrowings  Specific risks are incorporated by applying individ-
ual beta factors  The beta factors are evaluated annually based 
on publicly available market data  Discount rate before tax is 
approximately 10–13% 
Growth rates used to extrapolate cash flow
To extrapolate cash flows over the forecast period, growth fig-
ures start based on published research of each respective indus-
try  The long-term rate is conservatively estimated as equal to 
the expected long-term inflation rate 
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
A sensitivity analysis including all key assumptions is performed 
and management believe that no reasonably possible change in 
any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value 
to materially exceed the recoverable value  For all cash generat-
ing units except Asset Lifecycle Intelligence there is a significant 
headroom before any changes in key assumptions would cause 
a valuation adjustment, since the recoverable value totally is 
nearly double the book value  The performed sensitivity analysis 
demonstrates that the value of goodwill and other intangible 
assets with indefinite useful life is more than defendable even if 
the discount rate is increased with one percentage point or if the 
growth rate after the forecast period is decreased with one per-
centage point for all cash generating units except Asset Lifecycle 
Intelligence  For Asset Lifecycle Intelligence the recoverable 
amount would equal the carrying value if the discount rate would 
be increased by 0 6 percentage point or the terminal growth rate 
would be decreased by 0 5 percentage point  Even forecasts for 
sales growth and operating margin are included in the sensitivity 
analysis and no reasonable changes in these would cause a need 
of impairment

Income taxes comprise of:
• Current tax, meaning the tax calculated on taxable earnings for 
the period and adjustments regarding prior periods and;
• Deferred tax, meaning the tax attributable to taxable temporary 
differences to be paid in the future and the tax that represents 
a reduction of future tax attributable to deductible tempo-
rary differences, deductible loss carry-forwards and other tax 
deductions 
The income tax expenses for the year consist of current and 
deferred tax  Transactions recognised in other comprehensive 
income are including tax effects, i e  tax related to these transac-
tions are also posted in other comprehensive income  Tax related 
to transactions directly recognised in equity, is posted in equity

Pillar Two
The group is covered by the OECD’s model rules for Pillar Two  
Legislation on Pillar Two has been adopted in Sweden, where 
Hexagon AB is based, and will enter into force on 1 January 2024  
As the legislation on Pillar Two had not entered into force on the 
balance sheet date, the group has no related current tax expo-
sure  The group applies the exemption for reporting and providing 
information on deferred tax assets and tax liabilities related to 
income taxes from Pillar Two, as set out in the amendments to IAS 
12 issued in May 2023  
Under the legislation, the group is required to pay an additional 
tax for the difference between the effective tax rate calculated 
according to the GloBE rules for each jurisdiction and the minimum 
tax rate of 15%  
The group is currently evaluating its exposure to the Pillar Two 
legislation when it comes into force  Due to the complexity of the 
application of the legislation and the calculation of GloBE reve-
nues, the quantitative impact of the adopted legislation is not yet 
possible to estimate with reasonable certainty  Therefore, even 
106

for those subsidiaries with a reported effective tax rate above 
15%, there may still be tax consequences regarding Pillar Two  The 
group is currently working with tax specialists to help implement 
the legislation

NOTE 13 Government grants
During the year some of the subsidiaries within the Group have 
received government grants in their country  Government grants 
have been recognised in accordance with IAS 20  Receivables 
and revenues are recognised when there is a reasonable assur-
ance that the terms and conditions will be met, and it is reason-
able certain that the grant will be received  The government 
grants received was primarily related to education of employees 
and R&D funding  The table below shows how the grants are allo-
cated to functions

NOTE 14 Intangible fixed assets
Intangible fixed assets could be acquired separately, as part 
of a business combination or internally generated  The Group’s 
intangible fixed assets include mainly capitalised development 
expenses, trademarks and goodwill  Trademarks, goodwill, tech-
nology and customer relations are often acquired as part of a 
business combination, while capitalised development expenses 
are internally generated  Any impairments are reported as other 
operating expenses in the income statement  
The impairment for the year relates to impairment of releases 
of earn-out provisions  See Note 8 for further disclosures about 
impairment 
Capitalised development expenses
An internally generated intangible asset that are expected to 
generate a future economic benefit and whose cost could be 
determined reliably must, according to IAS 38, be recognised 
as an asset in the balance sheet  To assess if those criterias are 
fulfilled, the generation of the asset is classified into a research 
phase and a development phase  The research phase includes 
activities such as obtaining new knowledge, new products, sys-
tems, methods or materials  At a certain point in time, the activ-
ities change and includes design, construction and testing of 
chosen alternatives  This point in time differs between different 
projects and constitutes the inflection point between research 
phase and development phase  Hexagon expenses expenditure 
on research in the income statement and expenditures arising 
in the development phase must be recognised as an intangible 
asset in the balance sheet  If the research phase cannot be dis-
tinguished from the development phase, all expenditures will be 
reported as expenses in the income statement 
Capitalised development expenses are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisations and impairment  Amortisation 
is accounted for linearly based on estimated useful life and 
expensed as a research and development expense  Useful life 
for capitalised development expenses is 2-10 years  The average 
amortisation period is less than six years  The assets’ residual 
value and useful life are tested on each closing date and are 
adjusted if necessary 
Trademarks
Separately acquired trademarks are measured at cost  Trade-
marks acquired as part of a business combination are measured 
at fair value at acquisition date  In cases where the assets have 
a limited useful life, amortisation is estimated to 5 years  If the 
trademark can be used without any time limitations, it is not sub-
ject to amortisation according to plan  A new assessment is done 
yearly  The right to use the name Leica derives from a contractual 
useful life under an agreement that expires in 80 years’ time  The 
agreement contains clauses stipulating extension opportunities  
Since Hexagon is of the opinion that there is reason to believe 
that it will be possible to extend the agreement without consid-
erable expenditure, the value of the right to use the name Leica is 
not subject to amortisation 
Goodwill
Goodwill comprises the difference between the acquisition 
cost and fair value of the Group’s share of acquired business’ 
identifiable net assets on the date of acquisition  Goodwill is not 
amortised, but an impairment test is performed annually or more 
often if events or changes in circumstances indicate a possible 
need for impairment  Goodwill is recognised at acquisition value 
less accumulated impairment losses 
Other intangible assets
Both acquisition-related and separately acquired intangible 
assets are reported at acquisition value less accumulated amor-
tisation and impairment losses, if any  Other intangible assets 
consist of patents, customer relations and technology identified 
upon acquisitions  Amortisation is linear and is calculated on the 
original acquisition value and based on the asset’s estimated 
useful life  For other intangible assets, the estimated useful 
life varies between 2 and 20 years  Both the residual value of 
the assets and the useful life are tested each closing date and 
adjusted if necessary

NOTE 15 Tangible fixed assets 
Tangible fixed assets are recognised at acquisition value less 
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses  Acquisition 
value includes expenditure that is directly attributable to acquisi-
tion of the asset 
Gains and losses on the divestment of a tangible fixed asset are 
recognised in the income statement as other operating income 
or expenses and comprise the difference between the sales rev-
enue and the carrying amount  Amounts that can be depreciated 
comprise acquisition value less estimated residual value  The 
assets’ carrying value and useful life are impairment tested on 
every balance sheet date and adjusted if necessary 
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation is calculated on the original acqui-
sition value and based on the asset’s estimated useful life  The 
depreciation terms for various asset classes are:
• Computers 3–8 years
• Machinery and equipment 3–15 years
• Office buildings 20–50 years
• Industrial buildings 20–50 years
• Land improvements 5–25 years

NOTE 16 Leasing
Hexagon as lessee
Hexagon has the role of lessee mainly in contracts regarding real 
estate, vehicles and office equipment  The leases are recognised 
as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at 
which the leased asset is available for use  Lease payments are 
allocated to interest payments and repayment of debt  The inte- 
rest part is presented as paid interest in the cash flow analysis  
The right-of-use asset is depreciated on a linear basis over the 
shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease period  
Assets and liabilities arising from lease contracts are measured 
on a present value basis  Lease liabilities include the net present 
value of fixed payments, variable payments based on an index 
or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guar-
antees, exercise price of purchase options that will reasonably 
certainly be exercised and payments of penalties for terminating 
the lease, if such option will be exercised 
The future payments are discounted using the implicit interest 
rate in the contract  If that rate could not be determined, the 
group’s incremental borrowing rate could be used  The discount 
rate is updated semi-annually  
The right-of-use asset is measured and cost and comprises, 
besides the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liabil-
ity, of payments (less incentives received) made before the date of 
commencement, initial indirect costs and restoration costs  
Payments of lease contracts with a lease period below 12 months 
and lease contracts of low value assets are expensed straight-line 
in the income statement  Low value assets are mainly IT-equip-
ment, office furniture and other office equipment

The Group applies the simplified approach to measuring 
expected credit losses  The method uses a lifetime expected loss 
allowance for all trade receivables 
To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been 
grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days 
past due  The expected loss rates for trade receivables are a rea-
sonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets too, 
as the contract assets have substantially the same risk characteris-
tics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts 
The expected loss rates are based on the payments profiles of 
sales and the corresponding historical credit losses  The histori-
cal loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking 
information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of 
the consumers to settle the receivables 
Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable 
expectation of recovery  Impairment losses are presented within 
operating profit  Any recoveries of amounts previously written off 
are credited against the same line item 
The closing loss allowances for trade receivables reconcile to the 
opening loss allowances as follows:

NOTE 22 Pension provisions
Within the Group there are defined contribution plans as well as 
defined benefit plans 
For the defined contribution plans, Hexagon pays a fixed amount  
Expenditure for defined contribution plans is expensed as incurred  
Expected expenditure under defined benefit plans are recognised 
as a liability calculated in accordance with actuarial models, 
consisting of an estimate of future benefits that employees have 
earned through their employment during the current and prior 
periods  This benefit is discounted to its present value  The dis-
count rate is the yield on high-quality corporate bonds or if there 
is no deep market for such bonds, government bonds – that have 
maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations  
Changes of the defined benefit obligation related to changed 
actuarial assumptions including currency revaluation on defined 
benefit obligation in another currency than functional currency 
and experience-based adjustment are reported in other com-
prehensive income  Pension expense for the year consists of 
pensions earned in the current period and pensions earned 
from prior periods resulting from any changes in the plan  Pen-
sion liabilities, -assets net is multiplied with discount rate and 
accounted for as a financial expense  Obligations related to 
defined benefit plans are recognised net in the balance sheet as 
a provision, meaning after a deduction of the value of any plan 
assets  
Defined benefit plans for which the insurer (Alecta) cannot 
specify Hexagon’s share of the total plan assets and pension obli-
gations, pending this information becoming available, are rec-
ognised as defined contribution plans  This only exist in limited 
extent in Sweden

Characteristics of the pension obligations
The following applies for the Swiss plans which represent 89 per cent 
of the total pension obligations  The Swiss plans include the following 
sub-plans: retirement pension (main plan), disability pension, manage-
ment plan, early retirement plan and jubilee plan  The main plan, retire-
ment pension, is financed through an individual savings account  The 
plan defines a retirement credit in per cent of insured salary depend-
ing on the age of the plan member and it guarantees an interest rate, 
which is annually determined by the Pension Fund  The minimum legal 
rate as fixed by the Swiss government has to be credited to the mini-
mum savings account  The interest is not allowed to negative, even if 
the actual return on assets is negative (capital protection)  The other 
kind of plans in Switzerland are of similar nature 
Shortfall in the schemes in Switzerland must be covered by the 
employer, while surpluses can only become due to the beneficia-
ries  The value of plan assets has been reduced accordingly 
Remaining duration is in average 20 year

NOTE 23 Other provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group 
has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event 
and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to 
settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount can be 
made 
If the effect is material, the provision is determined by discount-
ing the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
the current market assessments of the time value of money and, 
where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability 
Warranties
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying 
products or services are sold  The provision is based on historical 
warranty 
data and a weighing of all possible outcomes with their associ-
ated probabilities  
Restructuring 
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group 
has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and 
the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly 
announced  No provision is posted for future operating losses 
Onerous contracts
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the 
expected benefits to be derived by the Group are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract

Restructuring provisions
Restructuring provisions primarily relates to a rationalisation 
programme that was introduced in the third quarter of 2023 and 
to transaction costs and cost in connection with the decision 
to freeze operations in Russia in the first quarter of 2022  The 
remaining part of restructuring provisions are mainly related to 
personnel and are expected to become due within 12 months 
Warranty provisions
Warranty provisions are estimated based on previous years 
statistical data and are evaluated on a regular basis  Since the 
warranty provisions are based on historical statistical data, the 
provided amount has a low uncertainty regarding the amount and 
timing of outflow  The majority of warranty provisions run over a 
period of 1 - 3 years  Estimated costs for product warranties are 
recognised when the products are sold 
Other provisions
Other provisions primarily consist of provisions for buildings, tax 
and legal disputes and also legally required personnel-related 
provisions  The personnel-related provisions are considered as 
long-term

NOTE 24 Financial risk 
management 
Risk management
Hexagon is a net borrower and has extensive international 
operations and is therefore exposed to various financial risks  
The Group Treasury Policy, approved by the Board, stipulates 
the rules and limitations for the management of the different 
financial risks within the Group  Hexagon’s treasury operations 
are centralised to the Group’s internal bank, which is in charge of 
coordinating the financial risk management  The internal bank is 
also responsible for the Group’s external borrowing and its inter-
nal financing  Centralisation entails substantial economies of 
scale, lower financing cost and better control and management 
of the Group’s financial risks  The internal bank has no mandate 
to conduct independent trading in currencies and interest rate 
instruments  All relevant exposures are monitored continuously 
and are reported to the Executive Leadership and the Board of 
Directors on a regular basis 
Currency risk
Currency risk is the risk that exchange rate fluctuations will have an 
adverse effect on income statement, balance sheet and cash flow  
Furthermore, the comparability of Hexagon’s earnings between 
periods will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates  
Hexagon’s operations are mainly conducted internationally and 
sales, costs and net assets are therefore denominated in a number 
of currencies  As of 1 January 2011 the presentation currency is 
EUR for the Group  The change decreases the currency exposure 
in both the income statement and balance sheet as well as in other 
comprehensive income  It also allows the Hexagon Group to better 
match debt to net assets  Currency exposure originates both from 
transactions in non-domestic currencies in the individual oper-
ating entities, i e  transaction exposure and from translation of 
earnings and net assets into EUR upon consolidation of the Group, 
translation exposure 
Transaction exposure 
Sales and purchase of goods and services in currencies other 
than respective subsidiary’s functional currency give rise to 
transaction exposure  Transaction exposure is, as far as possible, 
concentrated to the countries where manufacturing entities are 
located  This is achieved by invoicing the sales entities in their 
respective functional currency 
In accordance with the Group Treasury Policy the transaction 
exposure should not be hedged 
Translation exposure – Balance sheet
Translation exposure arises when the net assets are translated 
into EUR upon consolidation  Translation differences from net 
assets in other currencies than EUR reported in other compre-
hensive income during 2023 were -366 1 MEUR (435 4)

Translation exposure – Income statement
The consolidated operating income and expense is mainly gener-
ated in subsidiaries outside the Euro-area  Changes in exchange 
rates therefore have a significant impact on the Group’s earnings 
when the income statements are translated into EUR  Transla-
tion exposure related to actual and forecasted earnings is not 
hedged

Interest rate risk
The interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will 
adversely affect the Group’s net interest expense and or cash 
flow negatively  Interest rate exposure arises primarily from the 
external interest bearing debt  In accordance with the Group 
Treasury Policy the average interest rate duration for the external 
debt should be in a range from 6 months to 3 years 
During 2023 interest rate derivatives were used in order to man-
age the interest rate risk

Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that counterparts may be unable to fulfil their 
payment obligations  Financial credit risk arises when investing 
cash and cash equivalents and when trading in financial instru-
ments  To reduce the Group’s financial credit risk, surplus cash 
is only invested with a limited number by the company approved 
banks and derivative transactions are only conducted with coun-
terparts where an ISDA netting agreement has been established 
As the Group is a net borrower, excess liquidity is primarily used 
to amortise external debt and therefore the average surplus cash 
invested with banks is kept as low as possible 
Credit risk also includes the risk that customers will not pay 
receivables that the company has invoiced or intends to invoice  
Through a combination of geographical and business segmental 
diversification of the customers the risk for significant customer 
credit losses is reduced  An aging analysis of the receivables can 
be found in Note 18 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet the Group’s pay-
ment obligations in full as they fall due or can only do so at mate-
rially disadvantageous terms due to lack of cash resources  To 
minimise the liquidity risk, the Group Treasury Policy states that 
total liquidity reserves should at all times be at least 10 per cent 
of the Group’s forecasted annual net sales  
On 31 December 2023, cash and unutilised credit limits totalled 
1,268 6 MEUR (1,429 7)

Refinancing risk
Refinancing risk refers to the risk that Hexagon does not have 
sufficient financing available when needed to refinance maturing 
debt, due to existing lenders do not extend or Hexagon has difficul-
ties in procuring new lines of credit at a given point in time  Secur-
ing these requirements demands a strong financial position in the 
Group, combined with active measures to ensure access to credit  
In order to ensure that appropriate financing is in place and to 
decrease the refinancing risk, no more than 20 per cent of the 
Group’s gross debt, including unutilised credit facilities, is allowed 
to mature within the next 12 months without replacing facilities 
agreed 
Following a refinancing in 2021, Hexagon’s main sources of 
financing consist of:
1) A multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF) established during Q4 
2021  The RCF amounts to 1,500 MEUR with a tenor of 5+1+1 years 
2) A Swedish Medium Term Note Programme (MTN) established during 
Q2 2014  The MTN programme enables Hexagon to issue bonds up to 
a total amount of 20,000 MSEK  On 31 December 2023, Hexagon had 
issued bonds of a total amount of 11,650 MSEK (10,150) 
3) A Swedish Commercial Paper Programme (CP) established 
during 2012  The CP programme enables Hexagon to issue com-
mercial paper up to a total amount of 15,000 MSEK  Commercial 
paper with tenor up to 12 months can be issued under the pro-
gramme  On 31 December 2023, Hexagon had issued commercial 
paper of a total amount of 10,827 MSEK (7,464) and 63 MEUR 
(60)  The 1,500 MEUR multicurrency revolving facility support the 
commercial paper programme 
During Q2 2022 Hexagon issued a private placement bond to SEK 
(Swedish Export Agency) of 2,000 MSEK with a tenor of 7 years 
A term loan of 200 MEUR with a tenor of 2+1+1 years was estab-
lished during Q3 2021, of which 200 MEUR was utilised as per 31 
December 2023 
Three term loans of 250 MEUR each with a tenor of 2+1+1 years 
was established during Q1 2022, of which 750 MEUR was utilised 
as per 31 December 2023  
A two-year term loan of 350 MEUR was established during Q1 
2022, of which 350 MEUR was utilised as per 31 December 2023  
A term loan of 300 MEUR with a tenor of 1+1 years was established 
during Q3 2022, of which 300 MEUR was utilised as per 31 Decem-

Sensitivity analysis
The Group’s earnings are affected by changes in certain key factors, 
as described below  The calculations proceed from the conditions 
prevailing in 2023 and the effects are expressed on an annualised 
basis  Earnings in non-EUR subsidiaries are converted into EUR based 
on average exchange rates for the period when the earnings arise 
During the year there have been significant changes to the exchange 
rates of currencies that have the biggest impact on Hexagon’s 
earnings and net assets, CHF, CNY and USD  Compared to last year 
the EUR has weakened against CHF and strengthened against CNY 
and USD  Since Hexagon has a majority of the operating earnings 
denominated in CNY and USD, this had a negative impact on oper-
ating earnings  The strengthening of the CHF had a negative impact 
since a considerable part of the costs are denominated in CHF  An 
isolated strengthening in the exchange rate for EUR by 5 per cent for 
all assets and liabilities denominated in non-EUR currencies would 
have had an immaterial effect on net income but a negative effect 
on equity of 547 8 MEUR (535 3) net, and vice versa, after the impact 
of hedging 
During 2023, total operating earnings, excluding adjustments, from 
operations in other currencies than EUR amounted to an equivalent 
of 1,271 5 MEUR (1,232 7)  An isolated change in the exchange rate 
for EUR by 5 per cent against all other currencies would have a net 
effect on operating earnings of approximately 63 6 MEUR (61 6)  The average interest fixing period in the Group’s total loan portfolio 
as of year-end 2023 was less than one year  A simultaneous 1 per-
centage point change in interest rates in all of Hexagon’s funding 
currencies would entail a pre-tax impact of about 25 0 MEUR (25 5) 
in the coming 12 months earnings

NOTE 25 Financial instruments 
Financial instruments mainly comprise customer accounts 
receivable, loans, cash and cash equivalents and accounts 
payable 
Classification
The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories:
• Financial assets measured at fair value (through other compre-
hensive income or profit or loss)
• Financial assets measured at amortised cost
Classification depends on the Group’s business model and on the 
contractual cash flows the Group will obtain from the financial 
asset 
Gains and losses from assets measured at fair value will be rec-
ognised either through comprehensive income or through profit 
or loss  For debt instruments, this depends on the Group’s busi-
ness model  For equity instruments not available for sale, rec-
ognition depends on if the Group initially has chosen to measure 
the equity instrument at fair value through other comprehensive 
income  Reclassification does only occur if the business model is 
changed 
Measurement
Financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, if finan-
cial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss, 
transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the 
financial assets  Transaction cost for financial assets measured 
at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in the income 
statement  Purchases and sales of financial assets are rec-
ognised on settlement date 
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the 
Group’s business model and the cash flows generated by the 
financial asset  Financial instruments are classified in three 
different measurement categories:
• Amortised cost: assets held for obtaining contractual cash flows 
and those cash flows consist of compensation for capital and 
interest, are measured at amortised cost  Gains or losses when 
debt instruments are derecognised or impaired are recognised 
in profit or loss  Interest income is classified as financial income 
according to the effective rate method 
• Fair value through other comprehensive income: assets held for 
obtaining contractual cash flows and for sale and where the con-
tractual cash flows exclusively are compensation for capital and 
interest on outstanding capital is measured at fair value through 
other comprehensive income  Changes in recognised value is 
recognised in other comprehensive income except from impair-
ments, interest income and currency effects recognised in profit 
or loss  When the financial asset is derecognised the accumulated 
profit or loss is reclassified from other comprehensive income in 
equity to the income statement  Interest income is recognised as 
financial income according to the effective rate method  Currency 
effects are recognised as other operating income or other oper-
ating cost and any impairment is recognised as other operating 
cost 
• Fair value through profit or loss: assets that do not meet the criteria 
for being measured at amortised cost or fair value through other 
comprehensive income is measured at fair value through profit or 
loss  Assets measured at fair value through profit or loss consist of 
other long-term security holdings  Financial liabilities at fair value 
through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and 
financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value 
through profit or loss  Financial instruments held for trading consist 
of short term and long-term swap contracts  Gain or loss from a 
debt instrument measured at fair value through profit or loss is rec-
ognised in the income statement at net value, together with other 
profits and losses in the period they arise 
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value at the day of enter-
ing the contract and are subsequently measured at fair value at 
the end of every reporting period 
Impairment
The Group estimates on a forward-looking basis expected loss 
from debt instruments measured at amortised cost and fair value 
through other comprehensive income  The applied methodology 
for impairment depends on if there is a significant increase in credit 
risk 
For customer receivables, the Group applies the simplified meth-
odology according to IFRS 9, which requires an initial provision for 
expected losses

The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and 
disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation 
technique:
Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical 
assets or liabilities
Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a sig-
nificant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either 
directly or indirectly 
Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect 
on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market 
data

ments for acquired companies see below

The fair value of the estimated supplementary payments for 
acquisitions are evaluated regularly and includes management’s 
assessment of future financial performance of the acquired 
companies  Estimated supplementary payments for acquired 
companies have been discounted to present value using an inter-
est rate that is judged to be in line with the market rate at the time 
of acquisition  Adjustments for changes in market interest rates 
are not made on a regular basis, as this effect is considered to be 
immaterial  
The valuation method is unchanged compared to the previous 
period  In connection with the valuation of contingent con-
siderations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the 
purchase price allocation are reviewed  Any indication of impair-
ment due to the revaluation of contingent considerations is 
considered and adjustments are made to off-set the impact from 
revaluation

• LocLab, a leader in 3D digital twin content creation
• Projectmates, provider of SaaS-based enterprise construction

division providing help-desk support and services  Full year 2022 
revenues amounted to 12 MEUR  
Further information related to the acquisitions of Qognify is pre-
sented below  The other acquisitions are individually assessed as 
immaterial from a group perspective which is why only aggregated 
information is presented  The analysis of the acquired net assets 
is preliminary and the fair value might be subject to change  
Contingent considerations are recognised to fair value (level 3 
according to definition in IFRS 13) each reporting period and based 
on the latest relevant forecast for the acquired company  The valu-
ation method is unchanged compared to the previous period  The 
estimated liability for contingent considerations amounted to 175 8 
MEUR (162 1) as of 31 December, whereof the fair value adjustment 
in 2023 amounted to 41 6 MEUR (16 7)  In connection with the valua-
tion of contingent considerations the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed in the purchase price allocation are reviewed  Any indica-
tion of impairment due to the revaluation of contingent consider-
ations is considered and adjustments are made to off-set the impact 
from revaluation

Acquisitions analysis
Acquisition of Qognify 
In April 2023, Hexagon acquired Qognify, a leading provider of physical 
security and enterprise incident management software solutions 
Background and reasons for the transaction
Serving more than 4,000 customers worldwide in banking, gov-
ernment, logistics, manufacturing, retail, transportation and 
more, Qognify’s solutions link business and operational workflows 
with video data to minimise the impact of security, safety and 
operational incidents  End markets include everything from large 
utility networks and educational campuses to complex industrial 
facilities - the same customers that also benefit from Hexagon’s 
computer-aided dispatch (CAD) solutions, which play a crucial role in 
mobilising the people ultimately responsible for incident resolution  
Qognify’s solutions are a natural expansion of our public safety port-
folio, adding comprehensive and tightly integrated video capabilities 
that can provide dispatchers, responders and investigators with 
new levels of intelligence to serve and protect their communities 
From the date of acquisition, Qognify has contributed 36 9 MEUR 
of net sales in 2023  If the acquisition had taken place at the begin-
ning of the year, the contribution to net sales would have been 48 2 
MEUR  The contribution to the group operating margin has been 
slightly dilutive 
Acquisitions analysis 2022
Acquisition of ETQ
in April 2022, Hexagon acquired ETQ, a leading provider of SaaS-
based QMS (quality management system), EHS (environment, 
health and safety) and compliance management software  
Background and reasons for the transaction
ETQ’s SaaS QMS solution provides the data backbone for automat-
ing the collection and delivery of manufacturing quality control 
data, non-conformance reports, customer feedback and more  
It provides an enterprise view of quality management across the 
entire product lifecycle  ETQ’s broad portfolio of best-in-class 
applications comes with out-of-the- box functionality and no-code 
configurability, enabling customers to tailor the solution to their 
unique needs and optimise critical business processes to achieve 
their quality, safety and environmental goals  Given the strong fit 
across Hexagon’s manufacturing and process industries and the 
significant scope for geographical expansion, the transaction is 
expected to generate sales synergies of over 40 MUSD, with very 
strong incremental margins, by 2026  
From the date of acquisition, ETQ has contributed 50 6 MEUR of net 
sales in 2022  If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of 
the year, the contribution to net sales would have been 65 2 MEUR  
The contribution to the group operating margin has been accretive

Share Programme 
At the Extraordinary General Meeting on 1 December 2020, it 
was decided to implement the Share Programme 2020/2023, 
at the Annual General Meeting on 29 April 2021 it was decided 
to implement the Share Programme 2021/2024, on the Annual 
General Meeting on 29 April 2022 it was decided to implement 
the Share Programme 2022/2025 and on the Annual General 
Meeting on 2 May 2023 it was decided to implement the Share 
Programme 2023/2026 for key employees in the company  
Hexagon’s share programme is accounted for according to IFRS 
2 and is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment 
transaction, which means the programme is reported within 
equity  Social fees are reported as a liability in the balance 
sheet  Participants in the share programmes are offered to be 
granted, free of charge, performance awards which may entitle 
to shares of Class B if performance conditions are met during 
the measurement periods 1 January 2020 to 31 December 
2023, 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024, 1 January 2022 to 31 
December 2025 and 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2026  The 
purpose of the share programme is to strengthen Hexagon’s 
ability to retain and recruit competent employees, provide com-
petitive renumeration and to align the interest of the sharehold-
ers with the interest of the employees concerned  The total cost 
of the share-based incentive programmes is estimated at 60 
MEUR each and is recognised as a personnel expense in profit 
or loss during the vesting period  
The measurement period for the performance-based condi-
tion of Share Programme 2020/2023 was 1 January 2020 until 
31 December 2023  The performance-based condition for the 
Share Programme 2020/2023 related to the development of 
Hexagon’s earnings per share compared to a level set by the 
Board for target fulfillment during the measurement period, 
where the last financial year during the measurement period 
(2023) is compared with the financial year immediately preced-
ing the measurement period (2019)  The Board has confirmed 
fulfillment of the performance-based condition, an increase in 
the company’s profit per share during the financial year 2023 
compared to the financial year 2019, which pursuant to the duly 
adopted terms and conditions of Share Programme 2020/2023 
entitles eligible participants to receive shares of Class B in the 
company

Auditor’s report
To the general meeting of the shareholders of Hexagon AB (publ), 
corporate identity number 556190-4771 
Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts
Opinions
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
of Hexagon AB (publ) for the year 2023  The annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 
15–23 and 90–125 in this document 
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accor-
dance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of parent company and 
the group as of 31 December 2023 and its financial performance 
and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the 
Annual Accounts Act  The consolidated accounts have been pre-
pared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group 
as of 31 December 2023 and their financial performance and cash 
flow for the year then ended in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and 
the Annual Accounts Act  The statutory administration report is 
consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and con-
solidated accounts 
We therefore recommend that the general meeting of sharehold-
ers adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the par-
ent company and the group 
Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional 
report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit 
committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) 
Article 11 
Basis of opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Stan-
dards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing stan-
dards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those standards are 
further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section  We 
are independent of the parent company and the group in accor-
dance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and 
have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance 
with these requirements  This includes that, based on the best 
of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in 
the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5 1 have been provided to 
the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or 
its controlled companies within the EU 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Our audit approach
Audit scope
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing 
the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial 
statements  In particular, we considered where management 
made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signif-
icant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions 
and considering future events that are inherently uncertain  As in 
all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management over-
ride of internal controls, including among other matters consid-
eration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a 
risk of material misstatement due to fraud 
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient 
work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated 
financial statements as a whole, taking into account the struc-
ture of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and 
the industry in which the group operates 
The Hexagon Group comprises a large number of subsidiaries  
None of these subsidiaries have, individually, been deemed to 
be significant for the audit of the Group  For the Group audit, we 
have selected the Parent company and a large number of enti-
ties allocated across the Group’s five business areas for Group 
reporting  The majority of the subsidiaries in the Group are also 
subject to statutory audits according to local requirements  For 
other reporting units, analytical audit procedures are performed 
as a part of the audit of the consolidation  The Group audit team 
has performed audit work in a selected number of legal entities 
as well as performed work on the finance and accounting consoli-
dation processes, treasury operations among other 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of 
materiality  An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assur-
ance whether the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement  Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error  
They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they 
could reasonably be expected to influence the economic deci-
sions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial 
statements 
Based on our professional judgment, we determined certain 
quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall 
group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a 
whole  These, together with qualitative considerations, helped 
us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and 
extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of mis-
statements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial 
statements as a whole  
Key audit matters
Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our 
professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current 
period  These matters were addressed in the context of our audit 
of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and 
consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a sepa-
rate opinion on these matters 
Revenue recognition
Key audit matter
Hexagon’s customer offerings contain solutions in which 
hardware and software are integrated as well as services and 
licenses  The critical management estimates of customer con-
tracts include establishing the amounts that are to be recognised 
as income and when the income should be recognised 
For integrated customer contracts management needs to assess 
if revenue should be allocated to each revenue type as different 
accounting principles apply for these revenue types  Manage-
ment makes estimates of completed performance in relation to 
the contractual terms and conditions as these performance obli-
gations are or can be fulfilled at different points in time 
Part of Hexagons business comes from major long term, com-

Hexagon Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
Due to the degree of management judgment in arrangements 
containing multiple performance obligations, these types of 
arrangements have been a key audit matter in our audit 
Accounting principles for revenue recognition are included in 
Note 5 and key estimates and assumptions used for customer 
arrangements are included in Note 2 
How our audit addressed the Key audit matter
Our audit included, amongst others, a combination of testing of 
internal controls over financial reporting including procedures 
to test key application configurations, analytical procedures 
including analysing complete transactional data sets with soft-
ware tools to identify large transactions, anomalies, unexpected 
trends or variation  We have, in order to validate revenue for exis-
tence and accuracy performed detailed tests of new major con-
tracts in the Hexagon subsidiaries  We have also assessed that 
disclosures are appropriate 
Business combinations
Key audit matter
Acquisition of new businesses and the consolidation of new 
businesses (business combinations) include purchase price 
allocations of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities 
including identification of goodwill and other intangible assets  
The valuation is partly based on management assumptions of the 
future earnings of the acquired business and valuation of intangi-
ble assets at fair value 
The acquisitions contracts includes contingent earn-out pay-
ments which are included in the acquisition cost as a contingent 
consideration and remeasured at every reporting date and thus 
subject to management estimates and assumptions 
Business combinations and contingent earn-out payments have 
been a key audit matter in our audit due to the degree of manage-
ment judgment in identifying and accounting of various acquired 
intangible assets 
Accounting principles for business combinations are included in 
Note 1 and key estimates and assumptions used for fair values of 
acquired assets and assumed liabilities as well as identification 
of intangible assets and contingent consideration are included in 
Note 2 
How our audit addressed the Key audit matter
Our audit procedures included, amongst others assessment 
of significant purchase agreements, test of the purchase price 
allocations including calculation and accounting for contin-
gent considerations  We have involved our valuation special-
ists to challenge the valuation and calculation methods used 
by management  We have also assessed that disclosures are 
appropriate 
Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives
Key audit matter
The carrying value of goodwill, and other intangible assets with 
indefinite useful lives represent some 65 percent of reported 
total assets  IFRS require annual impairment tests or when there 
is an indication that values could be impaired given that the car-
rying value of these assets are not amortised 
Market data, Hexagon’s business plans and forecasts on future 
development forms the expectations on sales, earnings and cash 
flows that are central in the model to calculate a recoverable 
value to be compared to the booked carrying value 
We have focused on the valuation of goodwill and intangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives as these items involve a large 
degree of judgment on behalf of management in assessing future 
cash flows 
The key assumptions used and management’s sensitivity analy-
sis for how changes in key assumptions would affect the value in 
use are presented in Note 8  As stated in Note 2 the impairment 
test require management estimates and assumptions such as 
projected cash flows, future market conditions and discount 
rates 
How our audit addressed the Key audit matter
Our audit procedures included amongst others a review of man-
agement impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets 
with indefinite lives  We have examined whether Hexagon’s 
impairment test is based on the divisions’ (cash generating units) 
financial forecasts approved by management  We also evaluated 
the sensitivity analysis for changes in significant parameters, 
which, individually or on a collective basis, could imply the exis-
tence of an impairment requirement  Valuation experts have 
been involved to challenge the assumptions and estimates made 
by management  We have also assessed that disclosures are 
appropriate 
Other information than the annual accounts and consolidated
accounts
This document also contains other information than the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-14, 
32–89 and 130–147  The Board of Directors and the Managing 
Director are responsible for this other information 
Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
does not cover this other information and we do not express any 
form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information 
In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consol-
idated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information 
identified above and consider whether the information is mate-
rially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts  In this procedure we also take into account our knowl-
edge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the 
information otherwise appears to be materially misstated 
If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other 
information, we are required to report that fact  We have nothing 
to report in this regard 
Responsibilities of the Board of Director’s and the Managing 
Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsi-
ble for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance 
with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated 
accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU  The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible 
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable 
the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or 
error 
In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for 
the assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to con-
tinue as a going concern  They disclose, as applicable, matters 
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of 
accounting  The going concern basis of accounting is however not 
applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intend 
to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic 
alternative but to do so 
The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of 
Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things 
oversee the company’s financial reporting process 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a 
whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opin-

ions  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is 
not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs 
and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always 
detect a material misstatement when it exists  Misstatements 
can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, indi-
vidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to 
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of 
these annual accounts and consolidated accounts

Opinions
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board 
of Director’s and the Managing Director of Hexagon AB (publ) for 
the year 2023 and the proposed appropriations of the company’s 
profit or loss 
We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the 
profit be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the 
statutory administration report and that the members of the 
Board of Director’s and the Managing Director be discharged 
from liability for the financial year 
Basis for opinions
We cconducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those 
standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities 
section  We are independent of the parent company and the 
group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in 
Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities 
in accordance with these requirements 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Responsibilities of the Board of Director’s 
and the Managing Director 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appro-
priations of the company’s profit or loss  At the proposal of a 
dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend 
is justifiable considering the requirements which the company’s 
and the group’s type of operations, size and risks place on the 
size of the parent company’s and the group’ equity, consolidation 
requirements, liquidity and position in general 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organ-
isation and the administration of the company’s affairs  This 
includes among other things continuous assessment of the com-
pany’s and the group’s financial situation and ensuring that the 
company’s organisation is designed so that the accounting, man-
agement of assets and the company’s financial affairs otherwise 
are controlled in a reassuring manner  The Managing Director 
shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board 
of Directors’ guidelines and instructions and among other mat-
ters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company’s 
accounting in accordance with law and handle the management 
of assets in a reassuring manner 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and 
thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain 
audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance 
whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing 
Director in any material respect:
• has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which 
can give rise to liability to the company, or
• in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies 
Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association 
Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropri-
ations of the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion 
about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance 
whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with gener-
ally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect 
actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, 
or that the proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or 
loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act

the Esef report  
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 
1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a 
system of quality management including policies or procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
The examination involves obtaining evidence, through various 
procedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format 
that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts 
and consolidated accounts  The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks 
of material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or 
error  In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design 
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the audi-
tor considers those elements of internal control that are relevant 
to the preparation of the Esef report by the Board of Directors 
and the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing 
an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  The 
examination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness 
and reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Direc-
tors and the Managing Director  
The procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report 
has been prepared in a valid XHTML format and a reconciliation 
of the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consoli-
dated accounts 
Furthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of 
whether the consolidated statement of financial performance, 
financial position, changes in equity, cash flow and disclosures in 
the Esef report has been marked with iXBRL in accordance with

Auditor’s Limited Assurance Report on 
Hexagon AB’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions
To Hexagon AB (publ), corporate identity number 556190-4771
Introduction
We have been engaged by the Board of Directors and Group 
Management to undertake a limited assurance engagement of 
Hexagon AB (publ) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (scope 1 and 
scope 2) for the year 2023, as disclosed on page 84 in the Annual 
Report 2023, more specifically in the diagram “Sustainability Key 
Performance Indicators” 
Responsibilities of the Board and Group Management
The Board of Directors and Group Management are responsible 
for the preparation of the GHG emissions data in accordance 
with the applicable criteria, as explained on page 130  The criteria 
consists of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol – A Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard, and the accounting and 
calculation principles that the company has developed  This 
responsibility includes the internal control relevant to the report-
ing of GHG emissions that is free from material misstatements, 
whether due to fraud or error 
Responsibilities of the auditor
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the reported GHG 
emissions based on the limited assurance procedures we have 
performed  Our assignment is limited to the historical informa-
tion that is presented and thus does not include future-oriented 
information 
We conducted our limited assurance procedures in accordance 
with ISAE 3410 Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas 
Statements issued by IAASB  A limited assurance engagement 
consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for 
the preparation of the GHG emission data, and applying analyti-
cal and other limited assurance procedures  A limited assurance 
engagement has a different focus and a considerably smaller 
scope compared to the focus and scope of an audit in accor-
dance with International Standards on Auditing and generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden 
The audit firm applies ISQC 1 (International Standard on Quality 
Control) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of 
quality control including documented policies and procedures 
regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional 
standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements  
We are independent in relation to Hexagon AB (publ) according 
to generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden and have 
fulfilled our professional ethics responsibility according to these 
requirements 
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement 
do not allow us to obtain such assurance that we would become 
aware of all significant matters that could have been identified 
if an audit was performed  The conclusion based on a limited 
assurance engagement, therefore, does not provide the same 
level of assurance as a conclusion based on an audit  
Our procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board 
of Directors and the Group Management as described above  We 
consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the GHG 
emission data 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below  
Conclusion
Based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, 
nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that 
Hexagon AB (publ)’s GHG emissions data (as specified above) is 
not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the cri-
teria defined by the Board of Directors and Group Management

ESG related notes 
Reporting period and standards
Hexagon’s sustainability performance content and data pre-
sented in this report on page 50-89 covers the scope from Janu-
ary 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023  This report has been prepared 
in accordance with the GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Ini-
tiative (GRI 2021)  Furthermore, information from other standards 
and guidelines such as the SASB standards for Technology, Com-
munication, Software and IT Services have also been considered 
where appropriate  
Organisational Boundaries
Hexagon’s organisational reporting boundaries cover all its divi-
sions and subsidiaries  These are fully consolidated, following the 
control-based approach 
Operational Boundaries
Hexagon has completed a company-wide Scope 1 & 2 and Scope 
3 emissions inventory that covers all its production sites and 
offices  To calculate the GHG emissions, Hexagon has followed 
the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
– revised edition, the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance and GHG 
Protocol Scope Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3)  Scope 3 inven-
tory covers the following categories: purchased goods, capital 
goods, fuel-and-energy related activities, upstream transpor-
tation, waste generated, business travel, employee commuting, 
downstream transportation, use of sold products and end-of-life 
treatment  The Scope 3 categories not mentioned are consid-
ered not relevant to the company based on Hexagon’s business 
model  Hexagon is only emitting CO2 in its Scope 1  All figures 
reported are based on CO2e to account for the emissions from 
upstream and downstream activities 
Environmental data collection and reporting methodology
The data has been collected via Hexagon’s ESG reporting system, 
developed and aligned to the Financial reporting system during 
2023 for ESG data gathering and calculation purposes  
In 2023, environmental data was collected from all manufactur-
ing sites and all the facilities under our operational control with 
more than 35 FTEs  In order to cover the full scope of Hexagon’s 
operations, values have been extrapolated for energy consump-
tion, GHG emissions, water and waste  The extrapolation was 
performed on employees (FTEs) basis for sites not covered in the 
reporting system  The 2022 environmental data for energy con-
sumption, GHG emissions, water and waste has been restated to 
increase accuracy and year-over-year comparability 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 
Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from energy consumption are 
calculated using energy data in KWh by energy source (natural 
gas, diesel, electricity by country etc )  Scope 1 CO2 emissions are 
calculated using the emission factor for the corresponding type 
of fuel (source Defra 2023)  Scope 2 CO2 emissions are calculated 
with the location-based and the market-based methodology 
in accordance with the GHG Protocol Scope 2 guidance  Loca-
tion-based emissions are calculated using average country/
region emission factor (source IEA and eGrid)  Market-based 
emissions are calculated using residual mix electricity emission 
factor for European counties (source AIB) and the USA (source 
Green-e) and average country emission factors for all other coun-
tries (source IEA)  To capture the CO2 emissions from energy con-
sumption for sites not covered (offices with low number of people 
in them), we estimated the Scope 1 and 2 by associating CO2 emis-
sions per employee and extrapolating to the number employees 
in the sites not covered 
Scope 1 direct CO2 emissions include emissions from stationary 
combustion and vehicles of internal combustion engines in the 
company car fleet 
Scope 2 indirect CO2 emissions include emissions from electricity 
in all our facilities, purchased district heating and electric vehi-
cles in the company car fleet 
Scope 3 
Scope 3 emissions are calculated in line with the GHG Protocol 
for calculating Scope 3 emissions  All transport-related emis-
sions from fuel use emissions are reported on a Well-to-wheel 
basis  That includes the categories upstream & downstream 
transportation, business travel and employee commuting 
Purchased goods
These emissions are calculated for our major purchased prod-
ucts using the average-data method and their associated cradle-
to-gate emission factor  To capture 100% of our emissions in this 
category we extrapolated to our total spending on purchased 
goods 
Capital goods
These emissions are calculated using the average spend-based 
method for our total spending on capital goods  The emissions 
are reported on a cradle-to-gate basis 
Fuel-and Energy-Related activities not 
included in Scope 1 or Scope 2
These emissions are calculated using energy consumption data 
in KWh by energy course (natural gas, diesel, electricity by county 
etc ) and the associated upstream emission factor (Well-to-tank)  
For electricity the CO2 emissions are calculated using the average 
country upstream emission factor (source IEA)  For the fuels the 
CO2 emissions are calculated using the emission factor for the 
corresponding type of fuel (source Defra)  To capture the CO2 
emissions for sites not covered, we associated CO2 emissions per 
employee and extrapolated to the number employees in the sites 
not covered 
Upstream transportation
These emissions are calculated for our major purchased prod-
ucts using the distance-based method  For calculating the CO2 
emissions, we applied the appropriate mass-distance emission 
factor for the mode of transport used (source Defra)  Air, marine 
and road transport were the main modes of transport used for 
upstream transportation  To capture 100% of our emissions in 
this category, we extrapolated to our total spend on purchased 
goods 
Waste generated in operations
These emissions are calculated using actual waste data in kg 
by type of waste (hazardous, non-hazardous, residual), type of 
treatment (landfill, recycle, incinerated) and the corresponding 
emission factor (source Defra and Ecoinvent 3 8)  To capture the 
CO2 emissions from waste generated for sites not covered, we 
associated CO2 emissions per employee and extrapolated them 
to the number employees in the sites not covered 
130
In brief Financial plan Board of Directors’ report Corporate governance report Compliance Sustainability report Financial reports Additional information
Hexagon Annual and Sustainability Report 2023
Business Travel
Business travel emissions have been provided by the travel 
agency  The modes of transport that have been used for business 
purposes are airplanes, trains, buses, and rental cars  No hotel 
stays emissions have been included 
Employee commuting
Employee commuting emissions are calculated for our major 
company sites (globally represented) that cover one third of our 
employees using the average-data method  To capture the CO2 
emissions for sites not covered, we associated CO2 emissions per 
employee and extrapolated to the number of employees in the 
sites not covered 
Downstream transportation
These emissions are calculated for our major products sold using 
the distance-based method  For calculating the CO2 emissions, 
we applied the appropriate mass-distance emission factor for 
the mode of transport used (source Defra)  Air and road transport 
were the main modes of transport used for downstream trans-
portation  To capture 100% of our emissions in this category, we 
extrapolated to our total revenues from sold products 
Use of sold products
These emissions are associated with the products sold by Hexa-
gon during the year and aggregated over their lifetime  These 
emissions are related to electricity consumption of products 
over their entire life  We calculated these emissions for our major 
products using their technical characteristics (electricity con-
sumption in KWh) and the main assumption was a 10-year lifetime 
(even though more of our products have a lifetime more than 15 
years)  The emission factors applied was the average country 
electricity emission factor, for the main markets that the prod-
ucts sold as defined (source IEA)  To capture the CO2 emissions 
for the products that are not covered, we extrapolated based on 
the total revenues from sold products 
End of life treatment
Most hardware products have a lifetime longer than 15 years, so 
we can re-furbish the products and resale them even after 10 
years of use  When the products have come to their end of life, we 
seek to recycle major components  The pieces that are not recy-
cled are disposed  
Social data collection
The methodology used for the social data includes the total 
headcount at the end of the reporting period (31/12/2023)  By 
employees, we refer to everyone in an active employment rela-
tionship with our company, excluding interns 
As employee turnover we define the ratio of voluntary and invol-
untary attritions during the year to the total number of employ-
ees at the year-end  Group Management category includes the 
leadership of the company  Executives include all the employees 
directly reporting to the leadership  Level A includes all the 
employees directly reporting to the Executives  Level B includes 
all the other employees of the company

Description
Impact Materiality
Financial Materiality
Climate change 
(ESRS E1)
Our biggest opportunity lies in the impact we can 
make through our products  Hexagon is very well 
positioned to enable the shift towards a net-zero 
carbon economy in the industries we serve  To 
ensure an effective response to this opportunity, 
Hexagon is including ESG criteria in its innovation 
process  
We actively work with customers to offer efficiency gains in the 
process they operate  In many cases the gains come from ener-
gy-efficient solutions and from reduction of materials across 
the processes they need to deliver  This efficiency gains in sev-
eral cases reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support the 
transition to a low-carbon economy 
Furthermore, to ensure Hexagon also contributes to mitigating 
Climate Change, Hexagon has joined the Business Ambition for 
1 5°C  Hexagon has submitted to the SBTi (Science Based Tar-
get initiative) near-term and long-term net-zero science-based 
targets for carbon emissions covering our full value chain 
Having a financially stable business that is able to con-
tinue to grow positively impacts Hexagon’s long-term suc-
cess, ensuring Hexagon’s financial resilience as well as its 
reputation  This will enable us to further reinvest in opera-
tions and take advantage of opportunities  Achieving fur-
ther growth in adapting and mitigating climate change will 
further build customer confidence, motivate employees 
eager to contribute to a positive impact in the planet and 
ensure a resilient growth strategy 
Hexagon is incorporating climate transition risks (such as 
emissions trading and other regulatory developments) 
into our annual supplier risk management analysis 
Own workforce 
(ESRS S1)
Another opportunity we see is in ensuring an 
empowered workforce  To manage this topic, 
we have been promoting inclusive workplace 
through DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) Com-
mittee and divisional councils to cover all the 
countries our employees are located  
Hexagon believes driving the best practices within its workforce 
in terms of working conditions and providing an inclusive work-
force generate a positive impact in the communities where we 
operate  Hexagon delivers a positive impact from good hiring 
practices to eliminate any unconscious bias  In 2023, interactive 
sessions were held globally with external experts to address 
inclusive workplace  Cultural awareness has been also high-
lighted as an opportunity to thrive for inclusivity  
In Hexagon we understand that employees who feel 
engaged with their work are more productive, focused 
and driven  More importantly, we are a company of inno-
vation and we believe innovation happens when bright 
ideas come from a diverse view points  In this regards, 
having the best workforce sets us in the right position to 
tackle society’s challenges and ensures we have the best 
team in place to deliver sustainable business impact 
Workers in the value 
chain 
(ESRS S2)
This topic refers to Hexagon’s commitment to 
comply and promote internationally recognised 
standards and regulations that promote fair 
treatment of people along our value chain 
See more in the section ”Operational risk 
management” 
By ensuring that workers are treated fairly and by requiring safe 
and fair working conditions within suppliers, Hexagon promotes 
improvements in the quality of life and well being of the workers 
from our supply-chain partners  Not respecting human rights 
and not providing a safe mechanism to raise concerns can 
potentially result in physical and economic harm to people and 
communities 
Respect for universal human rights and labor standards is 
a prerequisite for suppliers to do business with Hexagon, 
as described in Hexagon’s Supplier Code of Conduct  By 
advocating high labor standards, Hexagon improves its 
reputation as a responsible business partner and foster 
enhanced collaboration with suppliers  The impact of this 
topic depends on financial impact the specific supplier 
could have for Hexagon  
See more in the section ”Responsible supply chain 
management” 
Business conduct and 
Responsiveness
These topics includes a wide variety of aspects 
such as improper use of goods, anti-corruption,

(57,171)  Shareholders in the USA accounted for the largest for-
eign holding, representing 26 1 per cent (30 1) of total shares fol-
lowed by the UK, representing 4 9 per cent (5 4)  The ten largest

cent (66 9) of the votes 
Share capital
At year-end 2023, Hexagon’s share capital amounted to 
85,761,451 EUR, represented by 2,705,477,888 shares, of which 
110,250,000 are of Class A with ten votes each and 2,595,227,888

0 03 EUR  Hexagon AB has acquired 21,100,000 of the company’s 
own shares of Class B as of 31 December 2023  The purpose of 
the repurchase is to ensure Hexagon’s undertakings in respect 
of the long-term incentive programmes (other than delivery of 
shares to participants in the incentive programmes), including 
covering social security costs 
Incentive programmes
At the Annual General Meeting on 2 May 2023, it was decided 
to implement the Share Programme 2023/2026  Participants in 
the share programme are offered to be granted, free of charge, 
performance awards that may entitle them to receive shares, 
provided that the performance conditions are fulfilled  The 
performance condition is related to the development of Hexa-
gon’s earnings per share compared with the target level set by 
the Board during the measurement period 1 January 2023 to 31 
December 2026, where the last financial year during the measure-
ment period is compared with the financial year preceding the 
measurement period  The fulfilment of the performance-based 
condition will be presented in the annual report for the financial 
year 2026 
Shares allotted are acquired by a third party, in its own name, 
and transferred to the participants in accordance with the Share 
Programme 2023/2026  The total costs for the share programme 
upon full fulfilment of the performance condition are estimated 
to amount to a maximum of approximately 60 MEUR allocated 
over the vesting period  
Dividend and share split
The dividend policy of Hexagon provides that, over the long-
term, dividends should comprise between 25 and 35 per cent of 
earnings per share after tax, assuming that Hexagon satisfies its 
equity ratio objective  Dividends are resolved upon by the Annual 
General Meeting and payment is administered by Euroclear 
Sweden 
The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of 0 13 EUR (0 12) per 
share for 2023  The proposed dividend amounts to 41 per cent of 
the year’s earnings per share after tax
