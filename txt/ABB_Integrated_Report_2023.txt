Enabling a low-carbon society is at the center of our purpose and 
value proposition and a key pillar of our Sustainability Agenda  In

Buildings are responsible for approximately 40 percent of the world’s 
energy consumption and 30 percent of global GHG emissions  We already 
have the technology needed to eliminate building emissions  Smart en­
ergy and asset management can make buildings energy efficient and low 
carbon  Therefore, we started our Mission to Zero™ program in 2019 – 
our journey towards significantly reducing GHG emissions of ABB sites, 
while supporting customers to reduce their GHG emissions, in line with 
our overall emissions reduction targets  Ours is a scalable program of 
smart building solutions combined with on-site or locally sourced renew­
able energy generation and storage  ABB’s Mission to Zero™ program 
continued to make progress, with nine sites added in 2023:
With these additional sites, our Mission to Zero™ program now encom­
passes 14 ABB sites  They contribute to our sustainability targets by us­
ing innovative and ambitious measures to improve environmental sus­
tainability  Our facility in Xiamen, China, for example, boasts 100,000 m² 
of solar panels – the largest such array at ABB – while our Mission to

At ABB, we are committed to writing the future of safe, smart and sus­

ABB to help Northvolt save energy and GHG emissions at the world’s 
ABB and Northvolt are strengthening their long-standing collaboration in 
the field of green batteries  Since 2017, ABB has been delivering electrifi­
cation and automation equipment to power Northvolt’s Ett gigafactory 
This partnership was expanded in 2023, with ABB providing process elec­
trification to power the world’s largest battery recycling facility, Revolt 
Ett, being built by Northvolt  The company plans to reduce the carbon 
footprint of its batteries to 10 kg CO₂e per kilowatt hour (kWh) by 2030, 
compared to an industry reference of 98 kg CO₂e per kWh  ABB’s switch­
gear and variable speed drives will match the speed of the processes tak­
ing place in the factory, ramping power up and down as required, saving 
energy, improving performance and lowering maintenance 
We will continue to focus on reducing GHG emissions directly and indirectly across our value 
chain  Building on our most recent achievements, we are:
•	 seeking validation of our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions targets from the SBTi
•	 intervening to reduce emissions in our value chain

ABB’s first platinum “zero waste to landfill” rating
Our Frosinone site in Italy has been recognized as a zero waste to landfill 
(ZWTL) site, according to the UL2799A Environmental Claim Validation 
Procedure for Zero Waste Classifications  Frosinone has achieved Zero 
Waste to Landfill Operations Platinum status, 100% diversion, with 9% 
thermal processing with energy recovery  Nine percent of the waste is 
thermally processed for energy recovery and the site has closed-loop re­
cycling of thermoset waste  Approximately 80 tons of plastic that would 
have been sent for waste-to-energy are returned to ABB’s supply chain 
for the manufacturing of products thanks to the closed-loop recycling of 
thermoset waste  Educating staff to develop an understanding and com­

a cultural shift across the site  Collaboration is key to the effective imple­

the life cycle of products – from production staff and product engineers 
in Frosinone to product design teams at different ABB locations  
As part of its Mission to Zero™ journey, ABB’s Frosinone site has im­

ABB’s principles of integrity and transparency apply across the entire 
Group  Our business areas and divisions take active ownership and re­

our commitment to integrity is a cornerstone of our business agenda  We 
continuously implement activities throughout the organization to further 
drive a culture of integrity in everything we do  For example, in 2023, we 
launched a monthly internal update highlighting key milestones in our in­

ness Weeks across our organization, which included a series of discus­
sions covering the topics of the ABB Code of Conduct  
Moreover, as part of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into 
with US authorities on December 2, 2022, ABB has implemented a work

The Integrated Report 2023 includes “forward-looking statements” 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and 
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  We have based 
these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations, 
estimates and projections about the factors that may affect our fu­
ture performance, including global economic conditions as well as 
the economic conditions of the regions and the industries that are 
major markets for ABB  The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “esti­
mate,” “continue,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan” 
and similar words and the express or implied discussion of strat­
egy, plans or intentions are intended to identify forward-looking 
statements  These forward- looking statements are subject to 
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among other 
things, the following: (i) business risks related to the global volatile 
economic environment; (ii) costs associated with compliance activ­
ities; (iii) difficulties encountered in operating in emerging mar­
kets; (iv) risks inherent in large, long term projects served by parts 
of our business; (v) the timely development of new products, tech­
nologies, and services that are useful for our customers; (vi) our 
ability to anticipate and react to technological change and evolving 
industry standards in the markets in which we operate; (vii) 
changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates; (viii) changes in raw materials prices or limitations of sup­
plies of raw materials; (ix) the weakening or unavailability of our in­
tellectual property rights; (x) industry consolidation resulting in 
more powerful competitors and fewer customers; (xi) effects of 
competition and changes in economic and market conditions in the 
product markets and geographic areas in which we operate; (xii) ef­
fects of, and changes in, laws, regulations, governmental policies, 
taxation, or accounting standards and practices and (xiii) other fac­
tors described in documents that we may furnish from time to time 
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 
Annual Reports on Form 20-F  Although we believe that the expec­
tations reflected in any such forward-looking statements are based 
on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that they will 
be achieved  We undertake no obligation to update publicly or re­
vise any forward-looking statements because of new information, 
future events or otherwise  In light of these risks and uncertainties, 
the forward-looking information, events and circumstances might 
not occur  Our actual results and performance could differ substan­
tially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements
