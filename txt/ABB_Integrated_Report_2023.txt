Chairman’s letter
After a successful transformation, ABB is in more robust health 
and better prepared for the future than ever before  Our per­
formance has improved and we have the right operating and 
remuneration models in place  Going forward, we are well-pre­
pared to realize ABB’s purpose of enabling a more sustainable 
and resource-efficient future with our leading technologies 
and fulfill our updated financial and sustainability targets

≡ Table of contents

Dear shareholders,
The past four years have been a transformative 
time for ABB  While dealing with some of the 
biggest challenges that a business can face – 
the pandemic, supply chain disruptions and 
wars in Ukraine and the Middle East – we have 
put in place a new operating model, improved 
our performance and prepared our company 
to help address humanity’s biggest challenge, 
climate change 
As Chairman, I am extremely proud of what we 
have achieved  We are delivering on our commit­
ments to stakeholders  We have strengthened 
our technology leadership in electrification and 
automation with many new innovations  And we 
are operating in a more efficient and transpar­
ent way, thanks to our decentralized operating 
model, which gives our divisions full ownership 
for their respective businesses 
Thanks to our market and technology leader­
ship and our new ways of working, we are able 
to play an important role in helping to meet the 
energy and resource needs of a growing global 
population while preserving the natural envi­
ronment for future generations  As a global 
leader with a strong presence in local commu­
nities, we are also promoting social progress 
around the world by being an exemplary em­
ployer and responsible corporate citizen 
Delivering on our commitments
Our achievements show that we are heading in 
the right direction and that we have the right 
people and organizational structure to take 
us forward  In 2023, we took advantage of the 
positive market environment and strong sec­
ular demand drivers to further boost our or­
der backlog while delivering record levels for 
revenues, Operational EBITA and margin with 
a significantly improved cash flow delivery  In 
light of this strong result and in line with our 
policy of paying a rising sustainable dividend 
per share over time, we will be proposing a div­
idend of CHF 0 87 per share to be voted on at 
the Annual General Meeting on March 21, 2024 
We are confident about ABB’s prospects, hence 
our ambitious new financial and sustainability 
targets that we presented at our Capital Mar­
kets Day in November 2023  Our purpose of 
enabling a more sustainable and resource-effi­
cient future through our technology leadership 
in electrification and automation fits perfectly 
with the needs of our customers and society  
We are ideally positioned to support the en­
ergy transition and help our customers move to 
low-carbon and circular business models 
Creating value now and in the future
We are actively managing our business port­
folio to ensure that our divisions fit with our 
company purpose and deliver on our commit­
ments to stakeholders  Our divisions must also 
be able to create more value by being part of 
ABB than they would elsewhere and serve mar­
kets that are profitable and growing 
Divisions that do not fulfill these criteria – even 
if they are strong businesses – are either re­
structured or earmarked for exit  In the past 
three years, we have sold two high-performing 
businesses and spun off our successful Turbo­
charging division (Accelleron)  This has allowed 
us to more closely align the group with our pur­
pose and position us in higher growth markets 
We have also transformed the way that mergers 
and acquisitions are done at ABB, empowering 
our divisions to go out and find targets that 
will defend their leading market positions and 
performance  In the past three years, we have 
seen several small division-led acquisitions  Go­
ing forward, we aim to make five to ten small to 
mid-sized bolt-on acquisitions per year, with six 
transactions closed in 2023 and several further 
that we could announce in early 2024 
Leading by example
ABB’s primary contribution to a low-carbon, 
resource-efficient future is developing and 
deploying leading technologies to help our 
customers optimize, electrify and decarbon­
ize their operations  We owe our success to our 
people, suppliers and the communities in which 
we operate  We have more than 105,000 em­
ployees around the world and a supply chain 
“As a technology leader in electrification and 
automation, ABB is ideally placed to support the 
energy transition and help our customers move

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
INTRODUCTION
consisting of thousands of companies, each of 
which has its own suppliers 
To secure ABB’s long-term future, we need to 
lead, both in the market and by example  As a 
business that means reducing our own green­
house gas emissions and adopting circular 
business practices  As an employer it means pro­
viding a safe, fair and inclusive working environ­
ment, in which our people can build their careers 
and are able to contribute to a better future  As 
a customer, it means helping our suppliers adapt 
to the fast-changing economic, regulatory and 
social environment that has driven ABB’s own 
transformation  As a leading global company it 
means being actively engaged in our communi­
ties through projects and programs that provide 
education and training, support diversity and in­
clusion, and help communities to develop, thrive 
and contribute to wider societal goals 
Committed to ethical business practices
Underpinning everything we do is our com­
mitment to embedding a culture of integrity 
and transparency throughout our value chain  
In 2023, we updated our ABB Code of Conduct 
and our Supplier Code of Conduct as well as our 
Human Rights policy, which reflects our commit­
ment to upholding the highest standards along 
our value chain  We also enhanced our anti-brib­
ery and corruption controls in line with a three-
year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) 
with the United States Department of Justice 
and Securities and Exchange Commission  ABB’s 
Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing 
compliance with the requirements of the DPA, 
instituted a year ago, which include the engage­
ment of an independent Board counsel expert  
Facing the future with confidence
In 2023, we have made strides in many areas  
As Chairman of ABB since 2015, I am convinced 
that our company is better prepared for the fu­
ture than it has ever been 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to 
thank our customers, employees, investors, part­
ners, suppliers, and other stakeholders for your 
commitment and trust  You give us the confi­
dence to strive for success, overcome adversity 
and contribute to a more sustainable, prosperous 
society  We look forward to continuing the jour­
ney with you in 2024 and beyond 
Best regards,
PETER VOSER

CEO interview
ABB’s purpose and the ABB Way operating model are key to 
our Group’s success  As Björn Rosengren explains, in 2023, 
they enabled us to deliver a record high Operational EBITA 
margin and present ambitious financial and sustainability 
targets at ABB’s Capital Markets Day in November 2023

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
INTRODUCTION
Björn, 2023 was an eventful year  What stood 
out most for you?
I did a lot of travelling and spoke to many of 
ABB’s customers, employees, investors, part­
ners and other stakeholders around the world  
What I heard gave me confidence that our mar­
ket offering is fully aligned with long-term cus­
tomer needs and secular trends 
In 2023, it was encouraging to see increases in 
investments in energy efficiency and decarbon­
ization  That’s especially true across the world’s 
three largest economies – the United States, the 
European Union and China 
The good news is that, according to the Inter­
national Energy Agency (IEA), it is still possible 
to limit global warming to 1 5°C above pre-in­
dustrial levels with existing technologies  If the 
world ramps up renewables, improves energy 
efficiency, cuts methane emissions, and ex­
pands electrification, the IEA estimates that we 
can deliver more than 80 percent of the emis­
sions reductions needed by 2030 
That, of course, shows that ABB is in a unique 
position to seize the opportunities ahead  We 
are working with our customers to electrify, op­
timize and decarbonize their operations  In the 
process, we are accelerating the energy transi­
tion and helping to build a low-carbon society  
Most importantly, ABB is at the heart of devel­
oping technologies to enable a net-zero future 
How did ABB perform in 2023?
We delivered a strong performance  Orders 
were slightly down but up on a comparable ba­
sis, and we delivered higher revenues, a record 
high operational EBITA margin and strong mar­
gin improvements in all four business areas  We 
expanded our earnings per share, cash flow and 
ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) 
We were fortunate to be operating in a strong 
market environment, but I think that this re­
sult also confirms that we are in the right mar­
ket segments and that our ABB Way operating 
model with its focus on continuous improve­
ment is working 
We also made significant progress towards 
achieving our sustainability goals  In 2023, we 
reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 
our own operations by 32 percent and helped 
our customers avoid 74 megatons of emis­
sions through our energy efficiency and carbon 
reduction technologies  We also reduced lost 
time caused by injuries (LTIFR) by 9 percent to 
industry-leading levels and increased the num­
ber of women in senior management positions 
to 21 0 percent, up from 17 8 percent a year ago 
I am truly proud of the ABB team for deliver­
ing such good results and creating value for all 
our stakeholders  I want to thank everyone for 
a very strong performance in 2023 
In November, you announced ambitious finan­
cial and sustainability targets at ABB’s Capital 
Markets Day  What makes you so optimistic 
about ABB’s prospects?
ABB has a clear purpose  We want to use our 
technology leadership in electrification and 
automation to enable a more sustainable and 
resource-efficient future  Over the past three 
years, we have transformed ABB  Today, our 
Group is decentralized and purpose-driven – 
and we have demonstrated to the markets 
that we can deliver on our promises  We have 
achieved a lot: we reshaped our portfolio, ad­
dressed profitability and embedded a culture 
of continuous improvement in the company  
These changes put us in a stronger position 
to address key global trends and opportuni­
ties – like the shrinking labor force, the accel­
erating need for automation, energy security 
and efficiency, and the energy transition  That 
is why we have been able to set ambitious new 
financial and sustainability targets  Among our 
key financial targets, we have lifted our target 
for long-term comparable revenue growth to 
5–7 percent (from 3–5 percent) and raised our 
operational EBITA margin target to 16–19 per­
cent (from ≥15 percent)  For a complete list 
of our new targets, see chapter Outputs and 
outcomes  To guide our ambition of enabling 
a low-carbon society, we have set new 2030 
and 2050 net-zero-aligned targets for our own 
operations and our value chain  We are aiming 
to help our customers avoid 600 megatons of 
GHG emissions through products sold from 
2022 to 2030  We also expanded our focus on 
preserving resources to include water, biodiver­
sity and sustainable land-use 
ABB wants to lead with a strong culture of 
integrity and transparency across our entire 
value chain  We have now rolled out our up­
dated Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of 
Conduct, which is part of our procurement 
terms and conditions  We also updated our 
­
Human Rights policy, which reflects our com­
mitment to upholding the highest standards 
along our value chain 
You like to say that innovation is in ABB’s DNA  
Did ABB come up with any breakthrough inno­
vations in 2023? 
One that I am very excited about is ABB Dyna­
fin™, a revolutionary new electrical propulsion 
system for ships that mimics the movement of a 
whale’s tail  ABB Dynafin™ has a rotating wheel 
11

with vertical blades, which makes it possible to 
propel and steer the ship at the same time 
It is truly ground-breaking both in terms of oper­
ational efficiency and maneuverability  And be­
cause ABB Dynafin™ is an electrical propulsion 
system, it can be powered by any energy source, 
including zero-emission batteries or fuel cells, 
further contributing to decarbonize shipping 
Another important innovation was our new 
IE5 SynRM Increased Safety motor for hazard­
ous area industries  This latest addition to our 
portfolio of energy efficient motors and drives 
reduces energy losses by up to 40 percent com­
pared to commonly used IE3 induction motors  
It also runs at lower temperatures than stan­
dard designs, prolonging the life of the motor 
and reducing maintenance needs; it also does 
not contain rare earth materials 
Finally, I want to mention the expansion of our 
large robot range  In 2023, we launched four 
new models and 22 variants that offer custom­
ers superior performance and up to 20 percent 
energy savings thanks to the lighter robot de­
sign and use of regenerative braking 
You have chosen a different digital strategy 
than some of your peers  Why do you think 
yours is the right strategy for ABB and how 
will you ensure that as technology evolves you 
are not left behind?
With our decentralized business model, our di­
visions have full ownership of their resources 
and strategies, which also includes their re­
spective digital strategies  This allows them to 
build on their proximity to customers to de­
velop more customer-focused offerings and 
gives them the freedom to work with other divi­
sions within ABB as well as external partners 
We create customer value through embedded 
software in our products  The majority of our 
products are digitally enabled, as well as al­
most half of our services  Around 55 percent 
of our employees in research and development 
(R&D) are focused on software development 
and our ABB Ability™ portfolio of digital solu­
tions is continuously expanding 
How are the rapid advances in artificial intelli­
gence affecting ABB’s business?
We are certain that generative artificial intel­
ligence (AI) has tremendous potential for our 
business  We have already identified more than 
100 AI-focused projects across our Group  For 
example, our Robotics division produces AI-en­
abled robots with integrated vision, which can 
work safely and autonomously in warehouses  
In our Process Automation business area, we 
continue to progress towards autonomous op­
erations, for which AI is an important enabler  
We also use AI for preventive maintenance and 
are working with our long-standing strategic 
partner Microsoft to unlock further customer 
value from operational data 
Looking at the global market environment, 
how concerned are you about the weakness of 
the Chinese economy?
Unfortunately, China did not develop as we had 
hoped in 2023  We had expected that the lifting 
of COVID-19 restrictions would trigger a recov­
ery, however, that did not materialize  One key 
reason is the continuing decline in the coun­
try’s property market, which hit residential and 
commercial construction hard  On top of that, 
order growth in China was hampered by cus­
tomers normalizing order patterns in response 
to a normalization of supply chains during the 
year  This impacted several of our businesses, 
most notably Robotics & Discrete Automation 
While it is difficult to predict how the Chinese 
economy will develop, we are convinced that 
China will remain an important market for ABB  
China is our second-largest market – we employ 
15,000 people there, covering the full range of 
our business activities, from R&D and manufac­
turing to sales and service  Our technology has 
an important role to play in addressing some 
of China’s most important challenges  We can 
help the country meet its dual-carbon goal, 
further decarbonize industry and transport, 
and address labor shortages with our robotics 
and automation solutions  We will continue our 
strategic focus of serving our customers in the 
country with locally manufactured products 
and solutions, as we do in all our markets

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
INTRODUCTION
Last year, you carved out E-mobility as 
a standalone business  Are you still planning 
an initial public offering?
Our ambition to separately list ABB E-mobil­
ity remains unchanged  The new management 
is currently concentrating on driving perfor­
mance, including some reorganization to de­
liver a more focused portfolio  We expect to be 
in a position to move ahead with a potential ini­
tial public offering (IPO) when these measures 
have been implemented successfully and the 
financial markets are constructive  Most impor­
tantly, we remain confident about the growth 
prospects in this field 
ABB continued to buy businesses last year and 
sold the Power Conversion division, marking 
the end of the announced divisional exits  
How have these portfolio moves worked out?
We have a clear strategy for our active portfolio 
management: we regularly assess our business 
portfolio to ensure that our divisions fit with 
our company purpose and strategic focus  We 
acquire businesses to secure a continued lead­
ing technology and market position  In 2023, we 
made six acquisitions across our four business 
areas  The divisions continue to build up their 
acquisition target pipelines and during 2023, 
we completed the acquisitions of the Siemens 
low-voltage motor business led by the NEMA 
Motors Division, strengthened our smart home 
technology portfolio with the acquisition of 
EVE systems led by the Smart Buildings Divi­
sion, and completed four other smaller bolt-on 
acquisitions primarily related to software and 
AI technology  
We also made a number of venture capital 
investments, which can be seen as an exten­
sion of our R&D  One is WindESCo, a US-based 
analytics software provider that is improving 
the performance and reliability of wind tur­
bines  ABB is a leading supplier of wind con­
verters for medium and low-voltage turbines 
and thanks to our investment, we will be able to 
offer customers a package that combines con­
verters with performance monitoring  Another 
investment was Pratexo, an edge-to-cloud 
platform innovator that is improving the secu­
rity, autonomy and resilience of decentralized 
electrical networks 
We also completed the sale of our Power Con­
version division in 2023, which completes all 
divisional divestments announced at the end 
of 2020  We now have 19 high-performing di­
visions, and approximately 70 percent of our 
revenues come from businesses with a growth 
mandate  We will continue to optimize the busi­
nesses and product groups within our divisions 
We aim to make five to ten small to mid-sized 
acquisitions a year and target to add 1–2 per­
cent growth from acquisitions through the eco­
nomic cycle 
In 2023, you delisted ABB securities from the 
New York Stock Exchange  Has that had any 
impact on your business in the United States?
The delisting from the New York Stock Ex­
change (NYSE) had no impact on our business 
or operations  With 26 percent of annual Group 
revenues and more than 40 manufacturing and 
distribution facilities, the United States contin­
ues to be our largest market 
We remain fully committed to our US custom­
ers, employees, investors, partners, suppli­
ers and other stakeholders  We are investing 
$170 million to increase capacity in the US to 
continue to grow our local-for-local footprint 
and serve our largest market  
We took the decision to delist from the NYSE be­
cause ABB’s shares are mostly traded on the SIX 
Swiss Exchange and via electronic trading plat­
forms  Consequently, we considered it excessive 
for ABB to have three stock exchange listings  
ABB’s shares are still listed on the SIX and Nas­
daq Stockholm, which reflects our Swiss and 
Swedish heritage  ABB securities in the US are 
still traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) mar­
ket  Once this trade falls below a certain level, 
we intend to apply for deregistration with the 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
and for termination of our equity reporting obli­
gations under the US Securities Exchange Act 
You have now been ABB’s CEO for four years  
What are you most proud of and what is next 
for you personally?
What’s important is that our ABB Way operat­
ing model is here to stay  With our performance 
improvements over the past four years, we have 
demonstrated that the ABB Way is the right 
model for our company and that the way forward 
is to continue to drive a decentralized culture 
From my side, I am happy with the changes and 
progress made at ABB so far and I am keen to 
continue the improvement journey  Working for 
ABB has been one of the best experiences of my 
life  We have a great team of talented and moti­
vated people, world-class businesses, fantastic 
technologies and we are making an important 
contribution to a sustainable future  I want to 
thank the entire ABB team for their commitment 
and strong performance in 2023, and also all our 
customers, employees, investors, partners, sup­
pliers, and other stakeholders for their continued 
trust and support  We all are looking forward to 
deepening our successful collaboration in 2024

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
INTRODUCTION
Unveiled ABB Dynafin™, a revolution­
ary new electrical propulsion concept 
for ships that mimics the movement 
of a whale’s tail  The new concept is 
expected to reduce propulsion en­
ergy consumption by up to 22 percent 
compared to conventional shaft-line 
systems, contributing to the shipping 
industry’s ambition of significantly 
­
reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
Acquired Germany-based Eve Sys­
tems, strengthening ABB’s smart home 
technology portfolio  The combined 
offer will accelerate ABB’s delivery 
of safe, smart and energy-efficient 
homes and buildings  Authorities are 
looking to incentivize retrofitting of 
existing building stock, as buildings 
account for approximately 30 percent 
of global carbon emissions (direct and 
indirect energy emissions including 
materials and construction) 
Expanded partnership with battery 
developer Northvolt to provide elec­
trification and automation technol­
ogies for the world’s largest battery 
recycling facility, Revolt Ett  The recy­
cling site will process 125,000 tons 
of end-of-life batteries and battery 
production waste each year, helping 
Northvolt achieve its goal of reducing 
the carbon footprint of its batteries 
by 90 percent by 2030 
Became official charging partner of 
Formula E, the all-electric motorsport 
world championship series  The tech­
nology partnership enables ABB to 
showcase its ground-breaking elec­
tric vehicle charging technology in 
­
cities around the world 
Delisted ABB’s American Depositary 
Shares (ADSs) from the New York 
Stock Exchange and converted to a 
sponsored Level I ADR program on the 
US over-the-counter market  Decision 
to delist was because ABB considered 
it excessive to have three stock ex­
change listings  ABB’s shares are still 
listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange and 
Nasdaq Stockholm, which reflects the 
Group’s Swiss and Swedish heritage 
Updated our Code of Conduct and our 
Supplier Code of Conduct to reflect 
ABB’s Sustainability Agenda with its 
foundation of integrity and transpar­
ency embedded throughout its value 
chain  The new Supplier Code of Con­
duct is included in ABB’s procurement 
terms and conditions  We have also up­
dated our Human Rights policy  
Completed the divestment of 
the Power Conversion division 
for $505 million to AcBel Polytech Inc  
With this transaction, ABB has com­
pleted all divisional portfolio divest­
ments announced at the end of 2020 
Completed acquisition of Siemens’ 
low-voltage NEMA motor business, as 
announced in 2022  The business em­
ploys around 600 people and generated 
revenues of approximately $63 million 
in 2021  The global NEMA motor indus­
try, roughly $2 7 billion in size, com­
prises industrial electric motors pri­
marily used within North America 
In 2023, nine venture capital invest­
ments were undertaken by ABB, includ­
ing an investment in US-based Wind­
ESCo, an analytics software provider 
for wind turbines, enabling ABB to of­
fer customers a package that combines 
converters with performance monitor­
ing  In another minority investment, 
ABB strengthened the partnership 
with Pratexo to co-develop edge com­
puting solutions to improve security, 
autonomy, and resilience for decentral­
ized electrical networks

The ABB share
In 2023, the price of ABB Ltd shares listed on 
the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) increased 33 per­
cent, while the Swiss Market Index (SMI) in­
creased 4 percent  The price of ABB Ltd shares 
on the Nasdaq Stockholm increased 41 percent, 
compared to the OMX Stockholm 30 Index, 
which increased 17 percent  Total shareholder 
return (including dividends) of ABB Ltd shares 
listed at SIX was 37 percent during 2023 
On May 23, 2023, ABB’s American Depositary 
Shares (ADSs) were delisted from the New York 
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and converted to a 
Level I ADR program, which gives US investors 
a continued investment option on the US over-
the-counter (OTC) market, in addition to the 
ordinary ABB share  Once the 12-month US Av­
erage Daily Trading Volume (ADTV) in ABB ADSs 
has fallen to less than 5 percent ADTV world­
wide, we intend to apply for deregistration with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
and for termination of its equity reporting obli­
gations under the Exchange Act 
Trading volumes have adjusted to a lower level, 
which is supportive of future deregistration  
We have continued to see strong interest in ABB 
from the US investment community which cur­
rently represents approximately 26 percent of 
our shareholders 
In 2023, approximately 28 percent, 27 percent, 
26 percent of shares issued were held in Swit­
zerland, Sweden and the United States, respec­
tively  The ten largest individual shareholders 
accounted for approximately 39 percent of the 
share capital on the same date  At December 
31, 2023, 75 percent of the shareholder base 
was made up of institutional investors with 
retail investors reaching 18 percent  On Decem­
ber 31, 2023, members of the Group Executive 
Committee owned a total of 945,871 shares in 
ABB  Members of the Board of Directors owned 
a total of 826,286 shares in ABB  Total own­
ership of ABB shares by the Group Executive 
Committee and the Board corresponds less 
than 1 percent of the capital and voting rights

Market leader with 
world-class technology
ABB as an investment
Our global number 1 and 2 positions in key electrification 
and automation segments strategically position us to 
capitalize on long-term megatrends characterized by the 
energy transition, energy security and efficiency, as well 
as the need for an increasingly flexible and efficient manu­
facturing set-up  Our equity story is based on five pillars:
Our market-leading position is based on 
­
cutting-edge technology, our ability to scale 
and decades-long domain expertise, all of 
which create high barriers to market entry for 
potential competitors  
Our four business areas all have a global num­
ber 1 or 2 position in their respective market 
segments  This gives us strong economies of 
scale and high pricing power, which results 
in higher profitability that enables us to con­
tinue investments in R&D to defend our leading 
market positions in electrification and auto­
mation  Our cutting-edge technology creates 
superior customer value by optimizing, electri­
fying and decarbonizing their operations 
Being present in various verticals for many 
decades has enabled us to build up unique 
domain expertise as well as a large installed 
base and strong long-term relationships with 
end-customers and channel partners  Our deep 
understanding of customer needs and opera­
tions is at the root of ABB’s success

We expect through-cycle average revenue 
growth of 5 to 7 percent on a comparable ba­
sis and 1 to 2 percent inorganic growth  Higher 
growth will be driven by a focused portfo­
lio, which has been aligned to more attractive 
growth markets and new ways of working  Our 
divisions are empowered to drive growth and 
investments based on their strategic mandates  
A key focus of ABB’s transformation has been 
to align our business with global megatrends, 
including the shrinking labor force, accelerating 
automation, energy security and efficiency, and 
the energy transition 
03
Increasing 
growth rates
In our decentralized operating model, decisions 
are made close to customers in our divisions, 
which have full ownership and accountability 
for their respective businesses  Select common 
processes ensure that each division benefits 
from being part of the Group  Our leaders are 
encouraged to cooperate where there are syn­
ergies and it makes sense for the business  
Lastly, our strong performance management 
system ensures performance can be tracked 
quickly and easily with standard key perfor­
mance indicators (KPIs) to facilitate speed  Each 
division is given a strategic mandate, which 
translates into strategic priorities and appro­
priate targets that are supported by incentives

INTRODUCTION
The creation of sustainable long-term share­
holder value is a key priority  Our compensation 
programs and policies are designed to encour­
age performance improvement without taking 
excessive risks  The Company’s shareholding 
requirements for Executive Committee mem­
bers are aligned with market practice and result 
in a wealth at risk for each Executive Commit­
tee member which is aligned with shareholder 
interests  Our strong balance sheet provides 
the capacity and flexibility for both solid cash 
distribution while still ensuring the financial 
strength to invest in organic and acquired 
growth  We are committed to a rising sustain­
able dividend per share (DPS) over time  Ad­
ditionally, our capital allocation priorities also 
state that we distribute any excess cash to our 
shareholders via buybacks  
05
Rewarding 
shareholders
ABB invested $770 million in capital expendi­
tures (CapEx)  Non-order related R&D invest­
ment was $1,317 million in 2023 or 4 1 percent 
of revenues for the year  The declared dividend 
amounted to $1,706 million  With respect 
to the year ended December 31, 2023, ABB’s 
Board of Directors has proposed to distrib­
ute a dividend to shareholders in the amount 
of CHF 0 87 per share  This is subject to ap­
proval by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting on March 21, 2024  The proposal is in 
line with our dividend policy to pay a rising, 
sustainable dividend per share over time 
In April 2023, we launched a new share buyback 
program of up to $1 billion  Together with the 
prior share buyback program, which ran from 
April 2022 to March 2023, we repurchased a 
combined value of $893 million during the 
year 2023  We plan to continue our share buy­
backs for the full-year 2024 in line with our 
capital allocation priorities to return excess 
cash to shareholders through buybacks

Our value creation model
By combining our technology leadership in electrification 
and automation with our decentralized ABB Way operating 
model, we create holistic value for our stakeholders while 
enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future 
Our value creation model provides a compre­
hensive summary of the holistic value we gen­
erate for all stakeholders across ABB’s entire 
value chain  It outlines the inputs that ABB 
needs to create value and illustrates how we 
transform these inputs into outputs and out­
comes through our decentralized operating 
model, the ABB Way  
The value we create for our stakeholders mea­
sures our success as a purpose-led company:
•	 by delivering leading financial performance, 
through world-class technology,
•	 by enabling a low-carbon society,
•	 by preserving resources,
•	 by promoting social progress,
•	 by embedding a culture of integrity and trans­
parency along the extended value chain 
Each of these outcomes and related outputs 
is explained in more detail in the chapter Out­
puts and Outcomes 
With our holistic approach to value creation, 
we also consider the complexities of the exter­
nal environment  These include risks, oppor­
tunities and exposure to key megatrends, as 
well as how ABB impacts and is impacted by 
our stakeholders  
To track and manage the inputs we use and 
the value we create, we leverage a broad set of 
qualitative and quantitative key performance 
indicators (KPIs) 
VALUE CREATION AT ABB
We understand value creation as the positive transformation of our financial and non-finan­
cial inputs into outputs and outcomes that fulfill our purpose of enabling a more sustain­
able and resource-efficient future  By focusing on holistic value creation, we deliver mean­
ingful progress for our stakeholders, the environment and our organization  In everything 
we do, we reflect on how ABB impacts and is impacted by our society and the environment

DIRECTION
Global megatrends are shaping our world  In­
herently complex and interconnected, they 
transcend borders and markets and are trans­
forming our societies  For businesses, govern­
ments and countries, megatrends pose both 
opportunities and challenges  At ABB, we be­
lieve that by relentlessly focusing on our pur­
pose and continuing to deliver a leading offer­
ing in electrification and automation, we are 
well positioned to capitalize on key megatrends 
and deliver superior value for our stakeholders 
in the long-term 
At ABB, we take a broad view of external devel­
opments including economic and geopolitical 
shifts  The key megatrends shaping our envi­
ronment, industries and markets are demo­
graphics, digitalization & artificial intelligence 
(AI), economic shifts and sustainability 
Demographics
By 2030, the world population is expected to 
grow by 8 percent to a total of 8 5 billion peo­
ple¹  At the same time, thanks to continued 
economic development, the middle class is 
expected to expand to more than half (~56 per­
cent) of the world’s population  The impacts 
will be a further rise in urbanization and an in­
crease in demand for often already constrained 
resources (e g , natural, energy, infrastructure) 
as cities expand and living standards improve  
Moreover, demand for highly qualified workers 
continues to increase and is expected to ex­
ceed labor supply, as working age population 
growth across several geographies is projected 
to remain stable or begin to decline as popula­
tion ageing accelerates 
To manage these shifts, businesses need to 
become more efficient and flexible in the way 
they operate and deliver their products and 
services  At ABB, our substantial investments 
in research and development (R&D) and man­
ufacturing capacity allow us to work hand-in-
hand with our customers to rethink their value 
chains, building on our leading automation and 
robotics offering 
Megatrends
Our business environment
As a global company operating in a dynamic business environ­
ment, we need to consider a wide range of economic, environ­
mental, political and social developments  To keep up-to-date, 
we closely monitor evolving risks and opportunities and main­
tain a continuous dialogue with our stakeholders  In line with 
ABB’s strategic direction, we continuously finetune our offering 
to reinforce our technology leadership in electrification and au­
tomation and position ABB to capitalize on global megatrends

Digitalization & AI
While AI has become increasingly prevalent in 
people’s lives over the past year, the advance of 
technology has long been moving us towards a 
future in which the physical and digital worlds 
merge  Across industries, digitalization is in­
creasing productivity and resource efficiency, 
and making manufacturing more flexible, while 
improving quality and simplicity 
In response to the shrinking labor force and the 
lack of qualified and experienced workers, de­
mand for autonomous operations continues to 
increase  At the same time, emerging technolo­
gies and increasing digital connectivity are fu­
eling the world’s data growth and consequently 
the need to process and make sense of such 
data – demand for data centers is expected to 
increase by a CAGR of ~10 percent until 2030² 
As a global technology leader, our Robotics & 
Discrete Automation and Process Automation 
business areas use AI, digital connectivity and 
software to make robots smarter, accelerate 
automation and generally push the frontiers of 
technology  Our Electrification and Motion busi­
ness areas provide many of the key technologies 
that data centers need to meet the increasing 
processing power required for AI applications 
Economic shifts
In our global business environment, the 
COVID-19 pandemic brought supply chain re­
siliency to the top of the agenda of executives 
across industries  Businesses invested heavily 
to rethink and diversify their strategies up- and 
downstream, coming out of the pandemic stron­
ger  However, the world has remained an uncer­
tain and highly volatile place as underscored by

nificant impact across our economies – be it the 
energy crisis in Europe and its knock-on effect 
particularly on Small and Medium Enterprises 
(SMEs) or the disruption of trade flows in the 
Red Sea, impacting 12 percent of global trade  
Global gross domestic product (GDP) growth 
has yet to recover and is slowing down com­
pared to before the COVID-19 pandemic, accom­
panied by high (but slowly declining) inflation, 
high interest rates, and persistent recession risk 
across major economies  For businesses across 
industries this translates into a different, less 
certain mid-term outlook and means reconsid­
ering investments in new capacity, uncertainty 
regarding customer demand and recalibrating 
assumptions of future growth markets 
ABB has a long tradition of local-for-local man­
ufacturing and extensive expertise in enabling 
companies to become resilient, flexible and effi­
cient through our process automation, robotics 
as well as machine and factory automation solu­
tions  As we continue to operate in economic un­
certainty and businesses address the risk asso­
ciated with single sourcing and manufacturing 
hubs and require more flexibility, better plan­
ning, monitoring and management capabilities, 
ABB is well positioned to help our customers to 
make their value chains more resilient 
Sustainability
In the face of climate change, our society faces 
an urgent and pressing need to transition to a 
low-carbon society and preserve natural re­
sources  At the same time, governments and 
businesses are under pressure to provide secure 
access to electricity to off-grid communities as 
well as to expand infrastructure and services to 
meet the needs of growing populations, which 
expect higher living standards  To enable an 
equitable transition, countries and businesses 
require solutions that are more energy efficient, 
that are powered by renewable or low-carbon 
energy sources, and that enable production with 
fewer inputs 
While growing populations and rising urban­
ization are putting pressure on infrastructure 
and increasing energy consumption, govern­
ments are setting clear climate objectives, and 
incentivizing investments in the expansion and 
upgrading of the energy system  To further ac­
celerate the adoption of low-carbon solutions, 
carbon pricing schemes are increasingly being 
used to encourage investment in energy effi­
ciency and new forms of energy  Even though 
the cost of capital remains high in today’s infla­
tionary environment, the most recent study by 
the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts 
that annual investments in low-carbon technol­
ogy will increase on average by 110 percent per 
year by 2030, while investments in energy effi­
ciency are expected to increase by 46 percent 
annually over the same period 
With ABB’s technology leadership in electrifica­
tion and automation, we are creating superior 
value for our stakeholders as well as driving and 
supporting the shift to a more sustainable and 
resource-efficient future  Approximately 50 per­
cent of our offering supports the trend toward 
electrification and about 35 percent directly 
enables higher energy efficiency, strongly posi­
tioning us to help companies reduce and avoid 
emissions, cut resource use and move toward 
circular business models

VALUE CREATION
Our value creation model underscores ABB’s 
commitment to create superior value for all our 
stakeholders in the short-, medium-, and long-
term  We relentlessly execute on our strategic 
direction in alignment with the ABB Way and 
foster a close dialogue with key stakeholder 
groups to continuously shape our position and 
policies, finetuning our decentralized ABB Way 
operating model  Through both business as 
usual and topic-specific strategic discussions, 
we are better able to understand our stakehold­
ers’ diverse perspectives on economic, environ­
mental, social and governance matters  Their 
valuable insights help ABB to further shape our 
strategic direction and the way we manage risks 
and pursue opportunities 
Stakeholder engagement
Engaging with our stakeholders plays a founda­
tional role in defining ABB’s strategic direction 
and driving our business  We are committed to 
consistent, transparent communication with our 
key stakeholder groups, including collaborative 
partnerships, customers, employees, govern­
ments and civil society, our investment com­
munity, and suppliers  We aim to build trust and 
foster long-term responsible business practices 
and relationships with our stakeholders  Stake­
holders shape our business environment and 
influence the way ABB operates; they are also im­
pacted by what we do and the value we create  
Stakeholder voices provide a unique perspective 
on market trends, innovations and technologies 
to help us better understand how these are per­
ceived across industries and geographies 
We regularly engage with our main stakehold­
ers in the normal course of business through 
various channels and as part of our materi­
ality assessment  We strive to address their 
concerns and embed their input into our 
decision-making processes  
Material topics for value creation
In 2023, ABB conducted its first double materi­
ality assessment, reflecting both an impact (in­
side-out) and a business (outside-in) perspec­
tive  This allowed us to get a clearer picture of 
our actual or potential impacts on the econ­
omy, the environment, society and people, as 
well as to understand the business implications 
emerging from risks and opportunities related 
to our material topics  The methodology took 
into consideration the following regulatory 
requirements and guidance of reporting stan­
dards: European Sustainability Reporting Stan­
dards (ESRS), the provisions of the amended 
Swiss Code of Obligations related to trans­
parency on non-financial matters, the Global 
Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Inte­

United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs)  Following the update of our materiality 
assessment in 2023, we mapped the topics that 
we identified in our double materiality assess­
ment against the 169 sub-targets of the SDGs  
This process allowed us to identify four SDGs 
on which we have the greatest impact  
The selection of these four SDGs is fully aligned 
with ABB’s purpose of enabling a more sustain­
able and resource-efficient future with our tech­
nology leadership in electrification and auto­
mation  While ABB contributes most to the four 
SDGs below, we recognize the importance of the 
other SDGs and endeavor to contribute to their 
achievement whenever and wherever possible

VALUE CREATION
Our inputs for value creation 
ABB’s main inputs for creating long-term value for our stake­
holders can be categorized into six main groups: financial, intel­
lectual, natural, manufactured, human and social & relationship  
Additional details on the crucial inputs, including both financial 
and non-financial aspects, are provided through a combination 
of qualitative and quantitative data across the input groups  
To drive sustainable value creation at ABB, we 
need to ensure that our inputs are not only bal­
anced, but also complementary: we leverage our 
market leading position and access to financial 
inputs to continuously invest in research and 
development (R&D), our people, acquisitions and 
partnerships, and our manufacturing footprint 
and capabilities, including more sustainable 
and resource-efficient operations  Through the 
combined use of all our inputs, we increase both 
our financial output – which again allowed us to 
raise our financial targets in late 2023 and return 
cash to our shareholders – and our contributions 
to a sustainable society, for which we were also 
able to increase our ambition level in 2023 
You are here

creation model
33
Financial input
Financial inputs are the sum of funds available 
to ABB, represented in our value creation model 
as $13 4 billion in total stockholders’ equity and 
$26 8 billion in total liabilities  They enable ABB 
to invest in intellectual, natural, manufactured, 
human, and social and relationship inputs, and 
to transform them into outputs and outcomes  
Intellectual input
Intellectual inputs encompass R&D, innovation, 
intellectual property as well as the collective 
knowledge of our employees, all of which give 
us a competitive advantage that is not fully rec­
ognized on the balance sheet  Our annual R&D 
investment amounts to approximately 4 per­
cent of revenues and we further complement 
this with venture capital investments in tech­
nology start-ups, focused on digital and soft­
ware  This has supported the development of 
cutting-edge technology, which enables us to 
create superior value for our customers by op­
timizing, electrifying and decarbonizing their 
operations  Advanced software is a key differ­
entiator of our digital offering and about 55 per­
cent of our approximately 7,500 employees in 
R&D are active in software development and we 
have more than 100 projects relating to Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) in progress across ABB  
Natural input
Natural inputs include the natural resources, en­
ergy and materials used to provide services and 
products to our customers  We strive to produce 
and deliver our products, solutions and services 
in the most efficient way possible, using natural 
resources only as necessary  For the year ending 
December 31, 2023, our total energy consump­
tion was 1,298 GWh, down from 1,413 GWh in 
2022  This is a direct result of our continuous 
efforts to reduce emissions across our sites and 
switch to renewable energy sources  Similarly, 
we continue to focus on our water withdrawal 
particularly in water-stressed areas, reducing 
our water withdrawal from 2,815 to 2,545 kilo­
tons compared to the prior reporting year  
Manufactured input
Manufactured inputs include the tools, ma­
chines, plants, infrastructure and buildings 
that we need to produce our products and 
provide our services  As of December 31, 2023, 
net property, plant and equipment amounted 
to $4,142 million, which was primarily invested 
in our 177 manufacturing sites in over 40 coun­
tries  Our focus on “global reach with local 
presence” allows us to quickly scale innovations 
across our markets  Moreover, our long tradi­
tion of local-for-local manufacturing allows us 
to remain close to customers, exemplified by 
approximately 95, 85 and 75 percent of prod­
ucts and solutions sold in Europe, China and 
the United States, respectively, being produced 
locally  We invest approximately $800 million 
annually in capital expenditure (CapEx) to en­
sure that our manufacturing capabilities can 
support our organic growth ambitions and se­
cure our efficient production 
Human input
The health, wellbeing, intellectual engagement, 
motivation and competence of our more than 
105,000 employees representing 173 nationali­
ties, as well as their ability to do their jobs well 
and fulfill their personal potential, are essential 
to our ability to create value  With our “Learn, 
Connect, Grow” framework at the heart of our 
people strategy, our employees spend on av­
erage 6 8 hours per year on training across our 
various learning platforms  In 2023, this also 
included newly launched mandatory integri­
ty-focused learning modules, accompanied by a 
strengthened emphasis on the tone of integrity 
set by top-level executives and middle man­
agement  Moreover, with a focus on providing 
a safe working environment in which our em­
ployees can learn, connect and grow, we further 
increased our rate of safety observation tours 
at our sites from 5 28 to 5 34  
Social and relationship input
Social and relationship inputs are the relation­
ships we have with our stakeholders, includ­
ing collaborative partnerships, customers, 
employees, governments and civil society, the 
investment community and suppliers  Having 
served various industry and market verticals 
for decades, we have developed unique domain 
expertise, a large installed base and long-term 
relationships with end customers and channel 
partners  This has enabled us to build a deep 
understanding of customer needs and opera­
tions  We always strive to maintain close rela­
tionships with our customers to ensure that we 
provide them with the highest value possible  
As a respected technology leader in electrifica­
tion and automation, we also engage in part­
nerships with universities and research institu­
tions to leverage our resources to create value  
We had numerous partnerships with universi­
ties and research institutions in 2023

VALUE CREATION
With our purpose at its core, the ABB Way de­
fines “how” we create superior value for our 
stakeholders through our business areas, di­
visions and lean corporate center  It has four 
components: our business model, as well as our 
approach to developing our people and culture, 
maintaining good governance, and nurturing 
our brand  
Owned and controlled by ABB’s Executive Com­
mittee and mandatory for all divisions, the ABB 
Way serves as the “glue” that holds the Group 
together and empowers our divisions with full 
ownership and accountability for their respec­
tive strategies, performance and resources  It 
provides select standardized policies, processes 
and systems (including portfolio and perfor­
mance management), supports a strong culture 
of governance and integrity, and enables us to 
build and protect our brand and reputation 
Business model
ABB’s business model determines how we gov­
ern our portfolio of 19 divisions, manage perfor­
mance and drive value creation for all our stake­
holders  Our business model ensures that under 
ABB’s decentralized structure with full divisional 
accountability, all divisions follow the Group’s 
strategic direction and pursue opportunities to 
cooperate, leveraging synergies to best serve 
our customers and create competitive advan­
tages  ABB’s belief that “smart leaders collabo­
rate” is deeply embedded in our business model; 
we consider it an enabler for future growth and 
efficiency in operations

Performance management 
We aim to consistently improve our perfor­
mance and deliver on our objective of superior 
value creation  Building on our “continuous 
improvement mindset”, we translate our strate­
gic priorities into short- and long-term targets  
Both financial performance and progress on 
sustainability are addressed by these targets 
and supported by appropriate incentives  
To plan, measure, monitor and review progress 
against our short- and long-term targets, ABB 
leverages an established scorecard system and 
a holistic set of KPIs, covering, among others, 
the core KPIs included in ABB’s financial target 
framework: revenue growth, Operational EBITA 
margin, Return on Capital Employed (ROCE), 
Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion to net income, 
and Earnings per Share (EPS) growth  Further­
more, incentives are leveraged to maintain a 
strong link between strategy and compensa­
tion programs  This also includes reinforcing 
our commitment towards sustainability, which 
is considered in both the Long-Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) for around 100 executives, includ­
ing Executive Committee members and (one 
measure) and the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) (at 
least two sustainability-related goals in the in­
dividual component) for Executive Committee 
members 
Portfolio management
ABB actively and systematically manages its 
business portfolio: value creation is focused 
both on organic and inorganic investments to 
further increase ABB’s exposure to megatrends, 
fill technology gaps, complement or expand our 
offering in high-growth segments, gain access 
to new geographies, and boost economies of 
scale through consolidation  Our capital alloca­
tion for investments in organic and inorganic 
growth follows a clear, two-pronged approach 
to maximize value creation; strategic mandates 
are leveraged to determine whether a division 
should focus on accelerating growth, whereas 
clear portfolio assessment criteria are used to 
facilitate decisions on portfolio moves  
ABB assigns each division a strategic man­
date – stability, profitability or growth – that 
reflects on its performance and translates into 
strategic priorities for each division  As part of 
our portfolio assessment approach, we review 
divisions’ performance and strategic mandates 
from a Group perspective  To reflect on our re­
vised financial and sustainability targets, we 
further evolved our portfolio assessment ap­
proach and also fully embedded sustainability 
into our methodology through a distinct sus­
tainability lens  Our ambition is to transition 
divisions to a growth mandate, enabling them 
to operate at best-in-class performance and to 
actively pursue value-creating, bolt-on acquisi­
tions in addition to organic growth 
The strategic mandates also imply that the 
majority of ABB’s bolt-on acquisitions should 
be made by divisions with a growth mandate, 
aiming for five to ten small- to mid-sized acqui­
sitions per year  Regardless of the acquisition 
size, the targets must match ABB’s assessment 
criteria in order to demonstrate that ABB is a 
better future owner and can deliver superior 
value creation  Similarly, existing businesses or

Enterprise risk 
management
Risks and opportunities
The proactive management of risks is an integral part of how we do busi­
ness  Our defined risk management framework enables us to identify and 
assess risks early and ensures that we have appropriate responses to manage 
and mitigate their effects across all levels of ABB  At the same time, we seek 
to turn the risks we face into potential opportunities and strive to manage 
both risks and opportunities in a responsible way  This approach supports 
the creation and protection of value for ABB, our stakeholders and society

Identification & 
assessment of risks
The enterprise risk management (ERM) pro­
cess is a holistic approach to identifying risks 
that could adversely impact the achievement 
of ABB’s strategic business objectives and lead 
to a material financial impact  The ERM process 
is embedded in our ABB Way operating model 
and encompasses all levels of our organization  
It provides our leadership, including our Exec­
utive Committee and the Finance, Audit and 
Compliance Committee (FACC) of the Board of 
Directors, with a comprehensive overview of 
the most critical risks faced by our business  
This information informs our overall strategy 
and risk discussions and allows us to make 
better-informed decisions to protect value and 
take calculated risks to create value, in a rapidly 
evolving societal and business environment 
The ERM process is cyclical and based on the 
ongoing identification, assessment, mitigation 
and monitoring of the most critical risks af­
fecting ABB  Our detailed methodology starts 
with the identification of our strategic business 
objectives  Next, we identify the most critical 
risks which could prevent us from achieving 
these objectives and lead to a potential ma­
terial financial impact in the next five years  
These risks are then assessed in terms of their 
potential impact, likelihood and speed of oc­
currence  Specific responses to address these 
risks are then planned, implemented and con­
tinuously monitored to ensure they remain ef­
fective  The ERM process categorizes risks as 
strategic, financial or operational:

TOP FIVE ENTERPRISE RISK CLUSTERS 2023
1  Strategic: 
Strategic risks can relate to any of the fol­
lowing: macroeconomic factors; market and 
technological developments; competitor and 
industry shifts; environmental, social and gov­
ernance aspects; geopolitical developments; 
and or portfolio management topics  These 
factors can have both negative and positive 
impacts on our business and create significant 
business opportunities 
2  Operational: 
Operational risks can relate to any of the fol­
lowing: engineering, manufacturing, project 
management and productivity topics; health, 
safety and environment management; integ­
rity and compliance aspects; supply chain 
management; cyber and information security 
threats; and or talent attraction and reten­
tion  These factors can have adverse impacts 
on the day-to-day operations of our business 
as well as positive impacts by being sources of 
competitive advantage  
3  Financial: 
Financial risks can relate to any of the follow­
ing: risks arising from ABB’s international fi­
nancial activities; fluctuations in currency or 
interest rates; volatility in commodity prices; 
accounting and financial reporting require­
ments; financial planning, analysis and man­
agement aspects; and or compliance with tax 
obligations  These factors are key to ensuring 
ABB has appropriate finance structures in place 
and that all financial compliance requirements 
enabling us to meet our capital needs are met  
We strive to turn risks into opportunities not 
only to minimize their downsides but to create 
value for ABB and our stakeholders, wherever 
possible  Our decentralized business model al­
lows us to stay agile, quickly adjust to changing 
environments, stay close to market develop­
ments and foster innovative responses to risks  
As highlighted by the results of this year’s dou­
ble materiality assessment, many of the identi­
fied material topics offer potential positive im­
pacts and opportunities to further create value 
for ABB, our stakeholders and society  For more 
details refer to the Stakeholder engagement 
and material topics section  
Below are the top five enterprise risk clusters 
facing ABB over the next five years as identified 
in the 2023 ERM process from across ABB:
IT SECURITY INCIDENT IN MAY
In May 2023, ABB became aware of an IT security incident impacting certain company IT systems  As a result of the 
incident, ABB started an investigation, notified certain law enforcement and data protection authorities, and worked 
with leading experts to determine the nature and scope of the incident  ABB also took steps to contain the incident 
and further enhance the security of its systems  Based on its investigation, ABB determined that an unauthorized 
third-party accessed certain ABB systems and exfiltrated certain data  Following a review of the data, where neces­
sary ABB has provided notifications to individuals and organizations  To date, ABB has no evidence to suggest that 
any information has been misused as a result of this incident  ABB will continue to monitor this

Sustainability risks 
and opportunities 
Risks and opportunities related to sustainabil­
ity are of particular interest to ABB due to their 
potential impact on our value creation  Align­
ment with our Sustainability Agenda calls for 
diligent identification and monitoring of such 
risks and opportunities 
Our financial performance is closely linked to 
sustainability issues  A subtle change in climate, 
the environment, regulation and social trend 
factors can affect our business environment 
and operations  That is why at ABB we embed 
sustainability in everything we do and engage 
with our stakeholders every step of the way 
The key risks associated with the material top­
ics from our double materiality assessment are 
described in the “material and non-material 
topics description” section of the Sustainability 
Report  Of these risks, those specifically relat­
ing to climate change (physical and transitional) 
are discussed in more detail in the TCFD Recom­
mendations report in the Sustainability Report

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
VALUE CREATION
ABB is particularly well positioned to help ad­
dress challenges related to climate change  The 
urgent need for energy-efficient and low-car­
bon products and solutions offers a huge op­
portunity for our business to contribute to a 
more resilient society  For 2023, we submitted 
our second report in line with TCFD Recommen­
dations to disclose our activities towards cli­
mate change mitigation, the reduction of neg­
ative environmental impacts, and how climate 
change affects our financial position and over­
all business strategy  Starting from the finan­
cial year 2024, companies listed in Switzerland 
will be required to report in line with TCFD Rec­
ommendations following the Swiss Ordinance 
on Climate Disclosures 
Governance
Our Board of Directors reviews and approves 
the Sustainability Agenda and related targets, 
including climate targets  The ABB Group Ex­
ecutive Committee validates the Sustainability 
Agenda and its implementation  It is responsi­
ble for reviewing strategic targets, including 
climate-related targets as well as for ensuring 
that a sustainability culture is embedded in our 
business decision making  The Sustainability 
Council is the operational body that oversees 
implementation of the Sustainability Agenda, 
reviews developments and monitors progress 
toward targets, including climate targets 
Risk management
We are constantly monitoring and assessing 
­
climate-related financial risks and have iden­
tified the following main risk categories as 
­
relevant to ABB: 
•	 physical risks: e g , increased frequency of ex­
treme weather events, such as floods or 
storms, affecting our direct operations and 
supply chain; and 
•	 transitional risks: e g , policy, legal and mar­
ket risks resulting from a transition to a 
lower-carbon economy 
We have started working on financial quan­
tification of these risks, commencing with 
physical risks affecting our operational sites  
Climate-related risks also apply to our sup­
pliers and customers across the value chain  
Upstream business continuity risks related 
to climate change, such as extreme weather 
conditions affecting our suppliers, are cov­
ered through comprehensive monitoring and 
development of our supply base  Our Sustain­
able Supply Base Management (SSBM) program 
helps us assess and improve the sustainability 
performance of our suppliers  For own sites, 
ABB has well-developed emergency response 
programs in place to manage potential impacts 
from climate change, such as storms or floods 
Opportunities
ABB capitalizes on climate-related opportu­
nities and seeks to build climate resilience 
through our ABB Way operating model  We can 
reduce direct operating costs by increasing 
resource efficiency and shifting towards 
renewable energy sources  We can also lever­
age market opportunities by investing in inno­
vative technological developments matching 
our customers’ needs and providing low emis­
sions products and services  Our end-to-end 
energy management solutions such as smart 
energy, building automation and mobility 
systems assist consumers to accelerate their 
sustainability journey 
Impact on our business resilience and strategy
We analyze risk exposure to our operations and 
consider three climate change scenarios to 
better understand the potential implications 
of different temperature increases in the fu­
ture  We are currently working on enhancing 
our analysis to include all our sites and sup­
pliers  Thanks to our technology leadership in 
electrification and automation, we can also 
help our customers and suppliers reduce their 
GHG emissions with our solutions for smart 
buildings, urban infrastructure, clean energy, 
energy efficiency and electric mobility

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
We deliver leading 
financial performance
Through our focused portfolio of sustainability and resource-efficient 
products, solutions and services, we generate increasing growth and 
­
profitability, driven by improvements in the quality of our revenues and the 
exposure of our decentralized divisions to high-growth markets  Strong 
financial performance allows for solid and attractive shareholder returns 
and sustains our long-term value creation for all our stakeholders 
In 2023 we delivered a strong operational re­
sult as we executed on our strong order backlog 
which was built up during a period of a strained 
value chain, inflation and an energy crisis  It 
was also another year of robust price execution 
where the linked benefits more than offset the 
inflation in labor costs while the margin was 
further supported by lower inflation-affected 
input costs and freight  In the wake of normal­
izing value chains, price management progres­
sively returned to be customer value driven  
The energy crisis triggered a series of customer 
investments throughout the year and further 
highlighted their need to ramp up investments 
in energy efficiency and transition to renewable 
energy sources  During the year we saw high cus­
tomer activity in the areas of LNG and hydrogen, 
highlighting how relevant our offering and tech­
nologies are to address these energy challenges 
The ABB Way operating model facilitates more 
efficient ways of working which, combined with 
a strong market situation, led to increased op­
erational results  We delivered record segment 
profit (Operational EBITA) and continued to see 
our divisions progress through their strategic 
mandates of stability and profitability before 
growth  With approximately 70 percent of di­
vision revenues now covered under a growth 
mandate we are increasingly shifting our focus 
to growth 
We continued to be active in portfolio manage­
ment and completed the sale of our Power Con­
version Division in July, marking the completion 
of the three announced divisional exits 
Active portfolio management continues to be 
part of our performance culture and is an inte­
grated part of the responsibilities of divisional 
management teams  This includes identifying 
areas for inorganic growth through acquisitions 
related to new segments, new market access, 
better economies of scale or filling technology 
gaps  The divisions also assess, based on sys­
tematic portfolio reviews, whether, ultimately, 
their division is the best owner of their differ­
ent businesses  During 2023, we also continued 
to make strategic venture capital investments 
focused in the areas of digital capabilities and 
software, completing nine new investments 
during the year and a number of follow-on in­
vestments in existing ventures  The divisions 
continue to build up their acquisition target 
pipelines and, during 2023, we completed the 
acquisitions of the Siemens low-voltage mo­
tor business led by the NEMA motors division, 
strengthened our smart home technology port­
folio with the acquisition of EVE systems led by 
the Smart Buildings Division, and completed 
four other smaller bolt-on acquisitions primar­
ily related to software and AI technology  As 
part of our future strategy, we continue to aim 
to complete five to ten small to mid-size bolt-on 
acquisitions each year  On the divestment side, 
the Energy Industries Division completed the 
divestment of its technical engineering consul­
tancy business in the United Kingdom and the 
Smart Buildings Division divested their indus­
trial plugs and sockets product line

Orders
In 2023, total orders decreased 1 percent (in­
creased 3 percent comparable¹) compared with 
2022  Excluding the impact of exchange rates 
and portfolio changes, three out of four busi­
ness areas contributed to the order growth 
from last year’s high level  Order momentum 
was strongest in the systems- and project-re­
lated business, driven predominantly by the 
medium-voltage segment and process-related 
industries  This offset softening from last year’s 
high order level in the short-cycle businesses, 
which was mainly evident in the residential con­
struction segment and across the board in dis­
crete manufacturing outside of the automotive 
industry, where customers normalized order 
patterns in the face of shortening delivery lead 
times  Growth rates were highest in the Process 
Automation business area even without the 
Turbocharging division (Accelleron), which was 
spun off in October 2022  While the absence of 
the Turbocharging division has impacted the or­
der growth across the business area by 12 per­
cent, the comparable order growth without the 
Turbocharging division was up by 24 percent  
The Electrification business area was flat (in­
creased 3 percent comparable¹) and the Motion 
business area reported mid-single digit growth  
The former was impacted by the sale of the 
Power Conversion business in July 2023  Ro­
botics & Discrete Automation reported a steep 
decline in orders of 26 percent (25 percent com­
parable¹), which were hampered by customers 
normalizing order patterns in a period of short­
ening delivery lead times, with added pressure 
from weakness in the underlying Robotics mar­
ket in China outside the automotive segment 
In 2023, orders increased 5 percent in the Amer­
icas (7 percent comparable¹), with orders grow­
ing in the U S , Canada, and Chile  The increase 
in the U S  includes two large orders totaling 
$435 million with a multi-year fulfillment pe­
riod  In Europe, orders decreased 3 percent 
(1 percent comparable¹)  Orders were higher 
in Norway and the United Kingdom while they 
declined in Switzerland and Poland  Despite the 
impact of an order reversal of approximately 
$170 million recorded in 2022, orders decreased 
in Germany as well  In Asia, Middle East and 
Africa, orders decreased 4 percent (increased 
4 percent comparable¹)  Order growth in India, 
Saudi Arabia and other markets more than off­
set the decline in China  
Revenues
In 2023, revenues increased by 9 percent 
(14 percent comparable¹)  The normalization 
of supply chains facilitated conversion of or­
der backlog into strong revenue growth during 
the year  All business areas reported revenue 
growth, benefiting from increased volumes and 
positive price development  Growth was high­
est in the Robotics & Discrete Automation and 
Motion business areas  The increase in the Ro­
botics & Discrete Automation business area re­
flects improved order backlog execution as sup­
ply chain constraints eased in 2023, as well as 
the negative impact early in 2022 of a COVID 19 
shutdown in China  The Electrification business 
area achieved a high single-digit growth rate 
despite the adverse impact from the divest­
ment of the Power Conversion division in July 
2023 which impacted growth rates in the busi­
ness area by 2 percent  The Process Automa­
tion business area saw mid-single digit growth 
in local currencies despite the spin-off of the 
Turbocharging division in October 2022, which 
had a negative impact on revenue growth in the 
business area of approximately 11 percent  
In 2023, revenues increased 16 percent in the 
Americas (18 percent comparable¹), where rev­
enues in the United States increased 17 per­
cent (21 percent comparable¹)  Revenues in the 
Americas also experienced strong growth in 
Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Chile  In Europe, 
revenues increased 12 percent (14 percent com­
parable¹) and were higher across all business 
areas  Revenue growth was the highest in Italy, 
Türkiye, Sweden, Norway and the United King­
dom  In Asia, Middle East and Africa, revenues 
were flat (increased 8 percent comparable¹) 
compared to 2022  Revenues grew strongest in 
India and Saudi Arabia while they decreased in 
China and South Korea  The spin-off of the Tur­
bocharging division in October 2022 also had 
a negative impact of 3 percent on the revenue 
growth in Asia, Middle East and Africa, 2 per­
cent in Europe and 1 percent in the Americas

Earnings 
Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 15 percent (16 per­
cent in constant currency1) to $ 11,214 million in 
2023, resulting in a gross margin improvement 
of 180 basis points to 34 8 percent  Gross profit 
improved in all business areas, with Electrifica­
tion, Motion and Robotics & Discrete Automa­
tion reporting high double-digit growth driven 
by both volume and price  Process Automation 
improved by at a high-single digit rate despite 
the exit of the high-margin Turbocharging di­
vision (Accelleron) driven by positive mix and 
project selectivity  
Income from operations 
Income from operations in 2023 amounted to 
$4,871 million, representing a strong increase 
of 46 percent from $3,337 million in the prior 
year  The improvement was primarily driven by 
stronger operational performance  Additional 
support to the improvement rate was due to 
2022 being burdened by non-operational items 
which included costs of approximately $315 mil­
lion relating to the legacy Kusile project as well 
as restructuring and restructuring related ex­
penses of approximately $250 million due to 
the exit of the full train retrofit business in non-
core operations, as well as charges related to 
the exit of the Russia business  Results in 2023 
were also supported from gains of $101 million 
from selling businesses, including the divest­
ment of the Power Conversion business  
Operational EBITA2 
In 2023, Operational EBITA increased by 20 per­
cent (20 percent in constant currency) to 
$5,427 million and the Operational EBITA mar­
gin2 was up by 160 basis points to 16 9 percent  
The main drivers for the improvement were 
positive impacts from successful price man­
agement and operational leverage on higher 
volumes, which more than offset inflation 
mainly in labor costs but to some extent also in 
commodities  Selling, general and administra­
tive expenses declined in relation to revenues 
to 17 2 percent from 17 4 percent in 2022  Oper­
ational EBITA in Corporate and Other amounted 
to -$430 million, of which -$167 million related 
to the E-mobility business which was negatively 
impacted by inventory related provisions as 
well as technology investments geared towards 
a more focused product strategy to secure a 
continued market leading position  
Net finance expenses and non-operational 
pension credits 
The net finance expenses increased by $52 mil­
lion to $110 million in 2023  In 2023, both inter­
est income and expense reflected increases in 
market interest rates especially for the U S  dol­
lar and Euro  Interest expense on our external 
debt was higher both due to higher debt levels 
but also higher interest rates on floating rate 
obligations  Non-operational pension credits 
declined by $98 million to $17 million compared 
to the same period last year, mainly driven by 
higher interest costs on the benefit obligations 
Income tax 
Income tax expense was $930 million with an 
effective tax rate of 19 5 percent down from 
22 3 percent in 2022  The tax rate in 2023 was 
positively impacted by a favorable resolution 
of a prior year tax matter relating to the divest­
ment of the Power Grids business of approxi­
mately 4 percentage points  Some additional 
tailwind was due to non-deductible regulatory 
penalties related to the legacy Kusile project 
which increased the tax rate in 2022 
Net income and earnings per share 
Net income attributable to ABB was $3,745 mil­
lion and increased significantly by 51 percent  
Basic earnings per share was $2 02 and in­
creased by 55 percent  The increase was driven 
by improved operational performance as well 
as lower adverse impacts from non-operational 
items than in 2022 discussed above

Balance sheet and cash flow
Net working capital
Net working capital amounted to $3,257 million, 
increasing slightly year-on-year from $3,216 
million driven mainly by an increase in receiv­
ables on the back of higher revenues, which was 
however largely offset by customer advances  
Net working capital as a percentage of reve­
nues1 decreased from 11 1 percent at the end of 
2022 to 10 2 percent at the end of 2023  
Capital expenditures
Purchases of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets amounted to $770 million 
in 2023 compared with $762 million in the same 
period last year 
Cash flows
Cash flows from operating activities in 2023 
provided net cash of $4,290 million, repre­
senting a significant increase of $3,003 million 
compared with 2022  The increase was driven 
by positive cash generation across all four busi­
ness areas on the back of higher earnings due 
to strong operational performance as well as 
a lower build-up of net working capital in 2023 
compared to 2022  In addition, in 2022, we had 
lower cash flows partially due to payments of 
approximately $315 million in relation to regu­
latory penalties for the legacy Kusile project as 
well as costs relating to business restructur­
ings and other business portfolio transactions 
Free cash flow¹ increased by $3,015 million to 
$3,667 million, and FCF conversion to net in­
come1 was at 99 percent 
Return on Capital Employed
The Group’s benchmark for the measure­
ment of returns is Return on Capital Employed 
(ROCE)¹ which increased by 460 basis points 
from 16 5 percent to 21 1 percent in 2023  Main 
driver of the improvement was higher Oper­
ational EBITA compared with 2022  Addition­
ally, in 2022, the Group’s ROCE was hampered 
by approximately 130 basis points due to the 
19 9 percent ownership interest in Hitachi En­
ergy which was sold in December 2022 
Net debt1
Net debt amounted to $1,991 million at the end 
of 2023, down from $2,779 million, year-on-
year  Net debt to EBITDA ratio¹ decreased to 
0 35 from 0 67 last year  During 2023, although 
we continued to return high amounts of cash to 
shareholders in the form of dividends and pur­
chases of treasury stock, we significantly grew 
cash from operating activities and this allowed 
net debt, as presented in the table below, to de­
crease by $788 million  The effect of exchange 
rate movements increased net debt by approx­
imately $433 million  In 2023, we received net 
proceeds of $553 million for the sales of busi­
nesses  We generated cash flows from operat­
ing activities during 2023 of $4,290 million and 
sold treasury stock in relation to our employee 
share plans for $154 million  We also issued 
shares in our subsidiary ABB E-mobility to third 
parties in private placements for $328 million  
These items were mostly offset by amounts for 
purchases of treasury shares of $1,258 million, 
as well as $1,713 million for the payment of the 
dividend to our shareholders  We made net 
purchases of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets of $623 million and made 
payments of dividends to noncontrolling share­
holders totaling $93 million

CHANGED
UNCHANGED
Looking to 2024, the geopolitical situation adds 
uncertainty, however we currently expect an­
other year of good performance  We expect a 
positive book-to-bill and revenues to be sup­
ported by execution of parts of the $21 6 bil­
lion order backlog  In the projects- and systems 
business we expect continued high customer 
activity, although we face high comparables 
from last year when large orders came through 
at a very high level  In total, order growth year-
on-year should show stronger momentum in the 
latter part of the year when comparables ease  
We expect to improve on comparable revenues 
as well as on Operational EBITA margin, and 
cash flow should benefit from continued strong 
operational performance and our continued fo­
cus on net working capital efficiency 
In full-year 2024, we expect a positive book-
to-bill, comparable revenue growth to be about 
5 percent and the Operational EBITA mar­
gin to slightly improve from the 2023 level of 
16 9 percent

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
We create value through 
world-class technology
We are continuously evolving our offering in order to remain a relevant 
and trusted partner to our customers  Technology and innovation are 
key to our stakeholder value creation and long-term success  We invest 
heavily in research and development and can count on a highly skilled 
and motivated workforce  We are committed to staying ahead by de­
veloping world-class technologies that help our customers address the 
world’s energy challenges, transform industries to reach new levels of per­
formance and embed sustainability in everything we do so we can leave 
­
behind a healthier and more prosperous world for future generations 
Our approach 
to R&D
At ABB, our R&D is driven by our 19 divisions 
and focused on developing and commercializ­
ing technologies that are of strategic impor­
tance to our future growth  As of December 31, 
2023, we had approximately 7,500 employ­
ees working in R&D centers across more than 
30 countries in six continents, of which about 
55 percent were focused on digital and soft­
ware development  Women make up 14 0 per­
cent of our R&D professionals, an increase of 
0 4 percentage points since December 2022, in 
line with our strategy to increase the share of 
women in our workforce, including in technical 
areas1  Every year, we invest a significant pro­
portion of our revenues in R&D  In 2023, we in­
vested $1,317 million or approximately 4 1 per­
cent of our 2023 consolidated revenues in R&D 
activities in our continuing operations  This 
represented an increase of 13% year on year  
We also spent $55 million on order-related de­
velopment activities  These are customer- and 
project specific efforts that we undertake to 
develop or adapt equipment and systems to 
the unique needs of our customers in connec­
tion with specific orders or projects  We make 
significant investments in future-oriented ac­
tivities and opportunities and spend it wisely 
according to individual business’ needs  
Since 2019, we have invested more than $6 0 bil­
lion in R&D representing an annual average of 
4 2 percent of revenues  R&D spend by division 
ranges from 1 to 13 percent of revenues, as each 
division is different and has different invest­
ment needs to maintain market leadership 
In addition to continuous product development 
and order-related engineering work, our R&D 
laboratories develop platforms for technology 
applications in our businesses  Our main dig­
ital platform is ABB Ability™, which is also the 
brand name of our digital solutions offerings  
We seek to maintain a balance between short- 
and long-term R&D programs and optimize our 
return on investment (ROI)  We keep control of 
our innovations by holding patents, copyrights 
and other intellectual property protections  
To complement our business-focused product 
development, our businesses invest jointly in 
collaborative research activities covering mul­
tiple technology areas including artificial intel­
ligence (AI), software, sensors, control and op­
timization, mechatronics and robotics, power 
electronics, communication technologies, ma­
terials and manufacturing, electrodynamics 
and electrical switching technologies  In this 
way, we advance technologies that are used 
in our products and common technology plat­
forms and apply them to multiple product lines  
Universities are incubators of future technol­
ogy and one task of our R&D teams is to trans­
form university research projects into indus­
try-ready technology platforms  We collaborate 
with multiple universities and research institu­
tions to build research networks and foster new 
technologies  We believe these collaborations 
shorten the amount of time required to turn ba­

ABB’s own emissions
All of our divisions and business areas are ac­
tively working to reduce scope 1 and 2 emis­
sions  In doing so, they are not only contrib­
uting to a more sustainable future, but also 
mitigating climate risks to our business and 
realizing cost savings  
In 2023, we made good progress towards our 
target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 
80 percent by 2030, compared to the base­
line of 2019  We also announced a new target 
of reaching net-zero in our own operations by 
2050  These targets are aligned with the Sci­
ence-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero 
Standard and have been submitted to the SBTi 
for validation 
In 2023, we achieved a reduction of 76 percent 
in our scope 1 and 2 emissions compared to 
2019  We reduced our energy consumption by 
21 percent compared to 2019 and will continue 
to invest in measures to reduce energy con­
sumption further  This includes investments 
in heat pumps, energy-efficient lighting and 
upgraded heating, ventilation and air condi­
tioning (HVAC) equipment or building automa­
tion systems  At the end of 2023, 64 percent of 
our energy consumption and 94 percent of our 
electricity came from renewable sources  
We continued to work towards our 2030 com­
mitment with the Climate Group  Our progress 
is as follows: 
•	 RE100: 100 percent of our electricity from re­
newable energy sources - Status 2023: 94 percent
•	 EV100: 100 percent electric vehicle fleet - Status 2023: 20 percent - As per December 31, 2023, we had over 
2,400 chargers installed at approx  190 loca­

Mission to Zero™ journey
Buildings are responsible for approximately 40 percent of the world’s 
energy consumption and 30 percent of global GHG emissions  We already 
have the technology needed to eliminate building emissions  Smart en­
ergy and asset management can make buildings energy efficient and low 
carbon  Therefore, we started our Mission to Zero™ program in 2019 – 
our journey towards significantly reducing GHG emissions of ABB sites, 
while supporting customers to reduce their GHG emissions, in line with 
our overall emissions reduction targets  Ours is a scalable program of 
smart building solutions combined with on-site or locally sourced renew­
able energy generation and storage  ABB’s Mission to Zero™ program 
continued to make progress, with nine sites added in 2023:
•	 Frosinone, Italy
•	 Nashik, India 
•	 Nogales, Mexico
•	 Santa Palomba, Italy
•	 Schaffhausen, Switzerland 
•	 Senatobia, Mississippi, USA
•	 Vaasa, Finland
•	 Xiamen, China
•	 Xinhui, China
With these additional sites, our Mission to Zero™ program now encom­
passes 14 ABB sites  They contribute to our sustainability targets by us­
ing innovative and ambitious measures to improve environmental sus­
tainability  Our facility in Xiamen, China, for example, boasts 100,000 m² 
of solar panels – the largest such array at ABB – while our Mission to 
Zero™ site in Nashik, India, has been certified as water positive 
At ABB, we are committed to writing the future of safe, smart and sus­
tainable electrification for everything from industry and buildings to 
infrastructure and transportation  We use intelligent systems for energy 
distribution, building automation, HVAC control, battery solutions, and 
motors and switches to help our sites achieve Mission to Zero™ status

ABB’s value chain emissions
Our ambition for a low-carbon society extends 
to our customers and suppliers, with whom we 
work closely to reduce emissions throughout 
our value chain  Together, we are working to­
wards greener emissions profiles to meet the 
expectations of markets, which are becoming 
more and more environmentally conscious 
We conduct Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) to 
identify opportunities for emissions reduc­
tions in the value chain and achieve our targets  
Information gained through LCAs is used for 
our Environmental Product Declarations (EPD)  
These are standardized documents validated by 
industry experts to declare quantitative infor­
mation of a product’s environmental impacts 
and allow to compare footprints of products on 
the market 
Customer emissions
As an industry leader, we help our customers 
reduce or avoid GHG emissions through the use 
of ABB products and solutions  We have three 
vectors through which we contribute to the 
energy transition: 
•	 increased efficiency through automation, 
high efficiency motors and drives, and indus­
trial software; 
•	 substituting fossil-fuel combustion for pro­
cesses and propulsion by electrification; and
•	 detection and avoidance of leakages of GHGs 
like methane and other harmful substances 
At ABB, by far the largest contribution we 
can make to a low-carbon society is in our 
­
customers’ operations  The lion’s share of our 
overall value chain GHG emissions is in our 
scope 3 downstream emissions from the use 
of sold products 
To help our customers reduce and avoid emis­
sions, we provide end-to-end support, which 
includes product-related trainings and sharing 
of experiences  We listen carefully to customer 
feedback and adapt our strategies and opera­
tions to best serve their needs 
As part of our efforts to enable a low-carbon 
society, we announced new SBTi Net-Zero Stan­
dard aligned targets for 2030 and 2050 at our 
Capital Markets Day on November 30, 2023  
These include new targets for our scope 3 
emissions, which we aim to cut by 25 percent 
by 2030, and by 90 percent by 2050, both ver­
sus a 2022 baseline  These targets were also 
submitted to the SBTi for validation  In 2023, 
our Scope 3 emissions increased versus 2022 
with key drivers being the increase in sales and 
in grid electricity emission factors  
Avoided emissions
Our energy-efficient motors and drives and 
automation and control systems help to reduce 
and avoid emissions in industries, buildings, 
infrastructure and transport  Using the lat­

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
we have strengthened the way we track and 
quantify our customers’ avoided emissions  
Avoided emissions describe the volume of 
GHG emissions our customers can avoid by us­
ing ABB products as compared to other avail­
able solutions, and cover the full product lifecy­
cle  Given our business model centered around 
electrification of processes, leading to decar­
bonization and energy efficiency, this is an im­
portant way to measure ABB’s positive impact  
In 2023, the products we sold to customers 
helped them avoid 74 megatons of emissions  
This fits our ambition to support customers in 
avoiding 600 megatons of GHG emissions from 
2022 to 2030, based on all the products we ex­
pect to sell over that period  
Supplier emissions
Our business areas and divisions are explor­
ing ways of reducing GHG emissions with our 
suppliers around the globe  One key action is 
to improve the transparency of product-related 
emissions by providing more granular environ­
mental product declarations to our customers  
To support such efforts, we bring our suppliers 
and customers together to share their ambi­
tions and plans to reduce GHG emissions  At a 
recent robotics supplier day in Shanghai, China, 
a customer described their ambition to create 
true net-zero products, without off-setting 
schemes, by 2030, inspiring our suppliers to de­
velop their own carbon-reduction plans 
Using lower-carbon transport, lower-carbon 
materials and materials that weigh less are 
key to reducing emissions, as is increasing the 
share of recycled materials in our products  
­
Initiatives to source materials closer to manu­
facturing locations also have a significant im­
pact on emissions from transport  Continued 
tracking of transport emissions on a per ship­
ment basis provides us with the required in­
sights to make informed and timely decisions 
As part of our ambitions to reduce our scope 3 
emissions, we work with our suppliers to reduce 
GHG emissions indirectly linked to ABB through 
our supply chain  In 2023, we started providing 
information and training sessions to our sup­
pliers and collecting information via our supply 
chain GHG emissions reduction program  This 
has provided us with an understanding of the 
maturity of our suppliers and where to prior­
itize our engagement to reach our target  We 
use the EcoVadis ESG platform to track suppli­
ers that have publicly announced emissions re­
duction targets, that have set SBTi targets, and 
that are on track to meet their targets 
OUTLOOK
We will continue to focus on reducing GHG emissions directly and indirectly across our value 
chain  Building on our most recent achievements, we are:
•	 seeking validation of our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions targets from the SBTi
•	 intervening to reduce emissions in our value chain
•	 tracking progress towards our targets 
•	 calculating and reporting on avoided emissions using the latest guidance from the WBCSD

ABB’s synchronous condensers stabilize UK’s power grid and enable 
shift towards low-carbon society
Traditionally, fossil-fuel powered turbines have provided the spinning 
inertia vital to maintain stable power networks in the UK  With the shift 
from fossil fuels to more renewable energy, the inertia in the grid is de­
creasing  ABB provides high-inertia synchronous condenser systems to 
Statkraft, a leading company in hydropower internationally and Europe’s 
largest generator of renewable energy  They supply around one percent 
of the UK’s projected inertia requirement for 2025, restoring the inertia 
that would be provided by five coal-fired power stations, saving UK con­
sumers around $122 million over six years

to using land responsibly  Our progress is summarized in this chapter  
Protecting against wild­
fires and extreme weather
Extreme weather and wild­
fires can cause large-scale 
power outages and are 
prompting utilities to im­
prove grid resilience by 
moving equipment under­
ground  ABB’s Elastimold® 
switchgear prevents out­
ages caused by flooding  
To meet rising demand, we 
are investing more than 
$40 million in a new manu­
facturing facility for Elasti­
mold® solutions in the US  
Our watertight solutions are 
extensively tested to ensure 
ingress protection for un­
derground power lines  To 
prevent wildfire ignition, we 
have developed a fire mit­
igation fuse that contains 
sparks within the device 
Embedding circularity 
by recycling old motors 
and drives
Building partnerships is key 
to moving towards circular 
business models  We part­
ner with recycling compa­
nies, like HKS and Mirec in 
the Netherlands or Stena in 
Sweden, to take back and 
recycle old equipment  In 
2023, we entered into new 
partnership with Germa­
ny’s Remondis, which recy­
cles old, inefficient motors 
in a sustainable way, and 
sends the retrieved met­
als to selected companies 
that ABB can use as sup­
pliers to manufacture new, 
energy-efficient motors  
The process saves on raw 
materials, energy and avoids 
GHG emissions compared to 
sourcing new metals, which 
is evidenced through sus­
tainability certificates  With 
this offering, ABB is able to 
provide solutions across the 
full lifecycle of motors, while 
moving toward a circular

and solutions will be covered by our Circularity 
Approach and evaluated against a clear set of 
key performance indicators (KPIs)  These cor­
respond to each stage of the product lifecycle, 
from design and sourcing, to product manufac­
turing, use and end-of-life  Enhancing our prod­
ucts in this way also extends the life of customer 
products that integrate our own  Our take-back 
services lead to modernization, refurbishment, 
re-use or recycling of products and components  
We facilitate this process by providing instruc­
tions for responsible end-of-life treatment  
In 2023, we enhanced our Circularity Approach 
and our four business areas began assessing 
their products and solutions and setting base­
line circularity scores for their portfolios  By the 
end of 2023, 31 percent of our product portfolio 
had been assessed against the guidelines of our 
Circularity Approach 
This transition is taking place not only in our 
customer solutions, but also in our operations  
ABB is taking a company-wide approach to pre­
serve the earth’s resources for future genera­
tions  Resource efficiency is at the center of the 
development of all our offerings and we aim to 
use sustainable materials wherever possible  
During the production process, we try to elim­
inate or recycle waste generated by our pro­
cesses and packaging

To reduce and, where possible, eliminate the 
use of hazardous materials from our opera­
tions, we rely on the ABB List of Prohibited and 
Restricted Substances  This list applies to every 
aspect of our operations, including procure­
ment, product development, production pro­
cesses, products, packaging materials, ser­
vice activities and construction sites  This is a 
heavily regulated area of activity and we update 
the list twice a year in keeping with local and 
international regulations and legislation  ABB’s 
four business areas have full ownership of their 
respective product material compliance obli­
gations, which include the European Union’s 
requirements for chemicals and products 
listed in the Substances of Concern in Products 
(SCIP) database 
We have developed a companion guide to the 
list to help ABB’s suppliers meet their obliga­
tions, which include partnering with us to iden­
tify and prevent restricted substances from 
entering ABB’s supply chain  In addition, ABB’s 
Global Terms and Conditions for suppliers and 
our Supplier Code of Conduct address prohib­
ited and restricted substances in the context of 
regulatory compliance 
In 2023, ABB’s business areas continued to col­
lect material compliance information on more 
than 50,000 articles and end products ac­
quired from their supplier base  This informa­
tion is securely stored in dedicated databases 
and is used for customer communications and 
product compliance statements

CASE STUDY 
ELECTRIFIC ATION 
ABB’s first platinum “zero waste to landfill” rating
Our Frosinone site in Italy has been recognized as a zero waste to landfill 
(ZWTL) site, according to the UL2799A Environmental Claim Validation 
Procedure for Zero Waste Classifications  Frosinone has achieved Zero 
Waste to Landfill Operations Platinum status, 100% diversion, with 9% 
thermal processing with energy recovery  Nine percent of the waste is 
thermally processed for energy recovery and the site has closed-loop re­
cycling of thermoset waste  Approximately 80 tons of plastic that would 
have been sent for waste-to-energy are returned to ABB’s supply chain 
for the manufacturing of products thanks to the closed-loop recycling of 
thermoset waste  Educating staff to develop an understanding and com­
mitment towards more sustainable waste management was made a pri­
ority  Frosinone’s goal was to go beyond individual actions and achieve 
a cultural shift across the site  Collaboration is key to the effective imple­
mentation of circularity programs  ZWTL engages staff working across 
the life cycle of products – from production staff and product engineers 
in Frosinone to product design teams at different ABB locations  
As part of its Mission to Zero™ journey, ABB’s Frosinone site has im­
proved the energy efficiency of each circuit breaker by 25 percent and 
has reduced its scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per product by 33 percent 
compared to a 2019 baseline  It sources 100 percent of its electricity from 
certified renewable sources

OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
Waste, water and biodiversity 
Managing the use of natural resources in a re­
sponsible way is a priority for ABB  Especially 
critical is the safeguarding of water as an es­
sential resource as well as ensuring good waste 
management and reduction, given the plane­
tary boundaries that the ecosystem is facing  
We have waste reduction programs at our sites 
throughout the world  In 2023, we reduced the 
amount of waste that ABB generates by 6 2 per­
cent to 167 kilotons compared to the previous 
year  In 2023, 86 percent of our waste was recy­
cled and 6 3 percent sent to landfill, down from 
6 4 percent in the previous year 
We have identified water and wastewater as a 
growth segment for ABB and offer wastewa­
ter solutions to reduce water extraction and 
freshwater pollution  The ABB Water Care pro­
gram improves our clients’ processes related to 
water and wastewater  It ensures optimal and 
reliable plant performance, extends the oper­
ating life of automation and electrical assets, 
and protects equipment and intellectual invest­
ments  The use of energy efficient motors and 
drives, as well as monitoring solutions, can save 
money and reduce the risk of downtime, which 
is fundamental in the water sector  
In relation to our own operations, we use the 
World Resources Institute’s Aqueduct global 
water risk tool to assess our exposure to wa­
ter risks  In 2023, 34 percent of ABB’s locations 
faced an enhanced level of water stress  We are 
constantly improving water usage and effi­
ciency and were able to reduce water withdrawal 
by 6 7 percent from 2022 to 2023  Our ABB wa­
ter management standard ensures prevention 
and mitigation of potential negative impacts 
through monitoring and action plans  Through 
water recycling initiatives and improved water 
management, we are targeting additional 30% 
reduction in water consumption by 2030  
Use of natural resources can also have a direct 
effect on biodiversity and natural habitats  
Given the rising importance of biodiversity and 
its interconnected relevance, also in conjunc­
tion with the discussion around climate change, 
we have identified and included biodiversity 
and land use as impacts in our 2023 double ma­
teriality assessment and will be establishing a 
strategic approach towards managing these 
topics, guided by the recently published Rec­
ommendations of the Taskforce on Nature-re­
lated Financial Disclosures

OUTLOOK
In our ongoing efforts to preserve resources, we continue to assess our product portfolio against ABB’s Circularity 
Approach, increase water efficiency and biodiversity  Moving forward, we will:
•	 increase the percentage of our product portfolio covered by our Circularity Approach 
•	 identify further opportunities to align our products with circularity principles
•	 continue to focus on solutions that reduce waste generation at our sites
•	 reduce water consumption in water-stressed areas where we and our customers operate
•	 use fauna and flora assessments to identify biodiversity interventions at and around our sites

At ABB, our occupational health and safety cen­
ters ensure the wellbeing of our diverse work­
force around the globe  Our talented and skilled 
employees are our most valuable asset and pro­
viding a safe and healthy work environment is a 
fundamental responsibility of ABB  
In June 2023, we updated our Health, Safety, 
Environment (HSE) and Security policy to rein-
force ABB’s commitment to putting health, 
safety, the environment and security at the cen­
ter of our activities  This commitment encom­
passes material sourcing, product design, oper­
ations and services  To realize global leadership 
in our operations, we have launched our Guid­
ing Principles for Resilient Operations  These 
support our HSE & Security Management Sys­
tem, which is based on internationally recog­
nized standards, principles and commitments  
All divisions are required to implement the ABB 
Way Management System for Corporate HSE & 
Security  The following three guiding principles 
set a framework underpinned by a set of behav­
iors we strive to follow at every level of our or­
ganization to achieve our objectives:
•	 lead with care: leaders create an environment 
where colleagues feel cared about and safe to 
speak up;
•	 engage and involve: everyone collaborates 
and draws on each other’s knowledge and 
strengths to ensure colleagues feel included 
and encouraged to contribute to our pro­
grams and HSE & Security performance; and
•	 learn and improve: everyone is encouraged to 
learn about and support continuous improve­
ment both as individuals and as a team and 
organization 
Each division is encouraged to develop safety 
programs that are appropriate for their 
opera­
tions  We coordinate preparations and 
responses to emergency situations, conduct 
internal safety inspections, and obtain third-
party verifications for our health, safety and 
wellbeing reporting  We have well-defined 
procedures to investigate work-related injuries 
and incidents and act promptly to mitigate 
negative impacts  We continuously strive to 
further reduce health and safety hazards  
Thanks to our health and safety measures, we 
continue to see a downward trend in our lost-
time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) to indus­
try-leading levels  In 2023, we recorded 376 work­
place-related injuries and one workplace-related 
fatality  An investigation into the fatal incident 
is currently underway, and we will draw on the 
lessons learned to prevent any future recurrence  
Considerations about health, safety, the envi­
ronment and security are at the heart of all our 
activities, including materials sourcing, product 
design, operations and services

Diversity and inclusion 
We take pride in the diversity of our workforce 
and seek to create an inclusive culture in which 
people feel empowered to share their ideas 
and perspectives  In this way, we encourage 
creative thinking which drives innovation – the 
key to ABB’s growth and success  We believe 
in diversity across all dimensions and that our 
differences make us stronger  That is why prog­
ress in diversity and inclusion (D&I) is embed­
ded in our long-term objectives 
Our 2030 sustainability target is to double the 
proportion of women in senior management 
roles to 25 percent compared to 2019  This is 
also a target in our wider Global D&I Strategy 
2030  In 2023, ABB increased the proportion 
of female senior managers to 21 0 percent, up 
from 17 8 percent in 2022  
We have also developed internal targets for D&I 
supported by a broad portfolio of actions:
•	 achieve equal gender balance among our early 
talent hires;
•	 provide broad access for our people to em­
ployee resource groups (ERGs); and
•	 improve our inclusion scores in our annual 
employee Engagement Survey 
Our aim is to create a welcoming environment 
in which people have a sense of belonging and 
can realize their full potential, both as individ­
uals and collectively  With a workforce span­
ning five generations, we foster collaboration 
through employee resource networks, various 
mentorship models, collaborative workshops 
and age-diverse teams  We facilitate leadership 
trainings and we have put in place targeted de­
velopment activities to ensure a stronger gen­
der balance at all levels including an increased 
leadership pipeline  We have reviewed our pro­
cesses and policies and piloted LGBTQ+ reverse 
mentoring programs to improve understanding 
and inclusion in the workplace  To support the 
mental and physical wellbeing of our people, we 
are improving accessibility in our premises and 
providing professional support  We also offer 
individual learning pathways, unconscious bias 
trainings, and research-backed resources to sys­
tematically drive awareness, engagement and 
progress  We will continue to explore opportu­
nities to facilitate diversity and inclusion, striv­
ing for an environment where every employee 
knows their uniqueness is an asset that adds 
value to our company  This creates shared value 
in the workplace, marketplace and community

OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
Employee development and wellbeing 
Investing in the professional and personal de­
velopment of our people is a key element of our 
long-term success  It supports the satisfaction 
and wellbeing of our employees, nurtures mo­
tivation and innovation, and facilitates talent 
attraction and retention  
We have multiple tools in place that enable our 
employees to make their voices heard  Our an­
nual employee Engagement Survey helps man­
agers better understand the experiences of our 
employees at ABB and how they feel about their 
jobs and the company  The survey also gives 
employees a channel to highlight opportunities 
for improvements in the workplace and ask for 
support to achieve the goals of their team or 
manage challenges that they may face  As the 
foundation of our organization, the perspec­
tives of our employees influence our business 
strategy and operations 
In 2023, our employee engagement score 
was 77 out of 100, up from 71 in 2019  In total, 
84 percent of employees, nearly 89,000 people, 
responded to the survey, which represents a 
significant increase since 2019, when response 
rate was at 65 percent  The results are bench­
marked by our external survey provider against 
a broader set of companies that ask similar 
survey questions  This allows us to monitor our 
ambition of achieving a top-tier score  Our 2023 
results highlight strengths in our safety cli­
mate, integrity and role clarity  The survey also 
showed that, while we have made good prog­
ress on removing barriers to execution, there is 
still room for improvement  
The actions we take to promote employee de­
velopment and wellbeing are principally con­
ducted on a local basis  For example, in the 
United States, our “HSE Week” in October 2023 
offered live sessions on mental health and 
wellbeing, among other topics  We also pro­
vide competitive benefits such as paid paren­
tal leave for employees worldwide and a global 
Employee Assistance Program (EAP)  We strive 
to give our employees the skills they need to 
adapt to change and stay competitive in a con­
stantly evolving business environment  This 
includes our talent management approach: 
“Learn, Connect, Grow” 
We encourage corporate volunteering for the 
benefit of our employees and impacted com­
munities  In 2023, ABB employees dedicated 
4,800 days for volunteer work  A strong focus 
was again on supporting educational initiatives, 
particularly in technology-related disciplines

Human rights and labor standards 
ABB is committed to respect the dignity and 
human rights of all people  Our goal is for hu­
man rights to be well-understood and well-inte­
grated into our operations and our value chain  
We adhere to international frameworks to iden­
tify human rights risks and potential impacts 
and to implement appropriate measures to mit­
igate adverse impacts  These frameworks and 
tools include: the United Nations’ Guiding Prin­
ciples on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), 
OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 
on Responsible Business Conduct, ILO Core 
Conventions on Labour Standards including ILO 
Convention No  138 on minimum age for admis­
sion to employment and ILO Convention No  182 
on the worst forms of child labor, and ILO-IOE 
Child Labour Guidance Tool for Business  With 
respect to child labor, these frameworks and 
standards include those which the Swiss Or­
dinance on Due Diligence and Transparency in 
relation to Minerals and Metals from Conflict-Af­
fected Areas and Child Labour (DDTrO) specifies 
as internationally recognized equivalent regula­
tions  As a result of our compliance with these 
frameworks and standards, we are exempted 
from the specific due diligence and reporting 
obligations of the DDTrO in regard to child labor 
Our Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Con­
duct and our Human Rights Policy establish 
our commitments to human rights and expec­
tations for each individual working at ABB or 
engaging with ABB’s business  For more infor­
mation about the update of the ABB Code of 
Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct in 2023 
see the following chapter  
In a fast-changing global value chain, we rec­
ognize that continuous improvements and 
adaptation are essential  In 2023, following 
consultations with internal and external stake­
holders, we updated our Human Rights Policy 
to better reflect our stakeholders’ expecta­
tions and to ensure compliance with interna­
tional frameworks and recent legislation  This 
update included a review of our human rights 
due diligence (HRDD) framework and salient 
human rights risks by each of our business ar­
eas, allowing us to identify opportunities for 
improvement in our human rights management 
processes  Consistent with the requirements 
of the UNGPs, the six elements of our HRDD 
framework are:
•	 policy commitment; 
•	 risk and impact assessment; 
•	 risk-based measures;
•	 embedding in our business processes;
•	 tracking and communication; and
•	 providing access to grievance and remedy  The scope of our assessment included all inter­
nationally recognized human rights as per the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
We mapped our full value chain to identify hu­
man rights risks and prioritized risks based 
on severity and likelihood  Human rights risks 
identified by internal and external stakehold­
ers as part of our materiality assessment were 
incorporated into the analysis  As a result of 
this work, we updated our salient human rights 
issues as follows:
•	 child labor,
•	 corruption and bribery ,
•	 environmental issues impacting human 
rights,
•	 fair employment,
•	 health and safety,
•	 human trafficking and modern slavery,
•	 impact on communities and land rights, and
•	 information security and data privacy  
Our roadmap for improvement focuses on com­
munication of our updated Human Rights Pol­
icy and building a broader understanding of our 
salient risks and mitigation actions, strength­
ening risk identification and management pro­
cesses, and monitoring performance  In case of 
any violation of human rights or codes of con­
duct, we take steps to ensure adequate remedi­
ation and consequences in line with applicable 
contracts and laws 
We maintain an operating model that brings 
human rights accountability and expertise to all 
ABB divisions to ensure adequate monitoring 
and management of our most salient issues at 
the highest operating level 
In 2023, 4,412 employees completed general hu­
man rights e-learning courses, and we provided 
targeted training for management and certain 
job roles, for a total of 1,006 participants  In ad­
dition, we trained 100 percent of security man­
agement specifically exposed to human rights

OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
OUTLOOK 
Maintaining a respectful, inclusive and diverse working environment while promoting the 
wellbeing of our people, maximizing safety, and investing in professional and personal de­
velopment will remain key to the success of ABB’s value proposition  To further progress on 
our targets related to promoting social progress, we will:
•	 further embed the Guiding Principles for Resilient Operations into our 
HSE & Security processes;
•	 use our updated Human Rights Policy and Due Diligence framework to deepen engage­
ment with our stakeholders and better embed human rights considerations in daily busi­
ness decisions, with the aim to further promote respect for human rights and effectively 
prevent and mitigate potential impacts;
•	 continue to increase the number of women in senior management including in P&L roles;
•	 revise the proposed Community Engagement Framework to maximize synergies and en­
able more impactful outcomes to communities  Our social investments will be focused on 
ensuring equitable access to education, providing emergency and disaster relief, support­
ing the environment and conservation, and leveraging technology and innovation to em­
power communities and enable the energy transition 
risks, and 43 new Human Rights Champions to 
further embed human rights expertise in our 
businesses  Total hours of instructor-led human 
rights training amounted to 1,840 hours  Our 
human rights self-assessment process reviews 
own operational sites periodically and 78 sites 
in 39 countries undertook human rights self-as­
sessments in 2023  
Human rights concerns, such as harassment, 
discrimination, forced labor and child labor, 
that are reported via our Business Ethics Help­
line are included in the statistics about cases 
reported in the Section Integrity  In 2023, we 
did not receive any reports of child labor or 
threats to freedom of association with respect 
to our employees  Two cases of attempted 
forced labor were reported by ABB service 
employees related to their treatment by cus­
tomers  These cases were resolved satisfac­
torily following intervention by appropriate 
management and the customers’ commitment 
to respect ABB’s policies regarding working 
conditions  For information about findings 
of non-conformance within our supply chain,

hold the highest standards of business ethics 
throughout our global value chain  It guides 
our employees, business partners and suppli­
ers to do business with integrity  In 2023, we 
issued an updated Code of Conduct under the 
tagline “We speak the same Code”  The update 
addressed the key operational integrity risks 
of Anti-Bribery & Anti-Corruption (ABAC) as 
well as workplace behavior issues reported in 
2022  As before, our Code of Conduct is avail­
able in the ABB Code of Conduct mobile app 
to provide employees and external stakehold­
ers with quick and easy access to the Code and 
related resources  The app design allows users 
to navigate easily through the Code’s focus ar­
eas, take short integrity training courses, seek 
help if they encounter an integrity issue, and 
report integrity concerns to ABB’s business 
ethics helpline 
Our ABB Supplier Code of Conduct was also 
updated in 2023 and explains in detail what we 
expect of our suppliers  The updated version 
addresses latest changes in regulatory require­
ments such as the German Supply Chain Act 
(Lieferkettengesetz, LkSG) and the Swiss Or­
dinance on Due Diligence and Transparency in 
relation to Minerals and Metals from Conflict-Af­
fected Areas and Child Labour (DDTrO)  It also 
aligns our Supplier Code with international 
human rights and environmental guidance and 
conventions, takes account of stakeholder ex­
pectations and emphasizes the role of suppliers 
in preventing and mitigating sustainability risks, 
especially when it comes to upholding human 
rights and reducing GHG emissions 
Our Supplier Code is part of our procurement 
terms and conditions as well as our supplier 
qualification, development and evaluation 
requirements  The updated implementation 
guide for the Supplier Code provides suppliers 
with hands-on advice on how to fulfill ABB’s re­
quirements and facilitates the effective imple­
mentation of the Supplier Code of Conduct  
Our Global Integrity Program includes integrity 
and communications training  The training mod­
ules are delivered in a virtual, e-learning format 
as well as face-to-face  We actively promote 
self-driven learning for all employees, supple­
mented by bespoke and role-specific mandatory 
training for those that face higher integrity risks 
in their roles  In 2023, we created an “Integrity 
Learning Toolkit”, which includes mandatory 
case study discussions on key topics in our Code 
of Conduct for all managers with their direct re­
ports (“Integrity Circles”), along with a strongly 
encouraged e-learning module  This “Code 
of Conduct package” is complemented by an 
“Anti-bribery and anti-corruption package” in­
cluding general awareness training and targeted 
modules for at-risk functions, and a “workplace 
behavior package,” which is mandatory for all 
ABB employees and promotes a culture of mu­
tual respect, tolerance, and collaboration  
We behave and 
do business in

ABB’s assets 
and reputation

Alongside these integrity-focused learning 
modules, managers at all levels of the company 
are modeling integrity behaviors and holding 
team discussions to ensure that their people 
understand what is expected of them when it 
comes to ethical conduct and treating people 
with respect  Newly established Integrity Com­
mittees in all business areas and divisions sup­
port this approach  In addition, our “Straight 
Talk” series continues as an impactful platform 
for sharing real-life integrity successes and fail­
ures at ABB, consolidating lessons learned and 
supporting our speak-up culture  It serves as 
a strong complement to our training program 
and has continued to be well received through­
out ABB as a transparent method for communi­
cating integrity learnings 
To track the effectiveness of our integrity-re­
lated initiatives, we utilize data analytics and 
conduct transaction monitoring  Our Integrity 
Analytics Report, a live dashboard available 
throughout ABB via our integrity web portal, 
provides insights into our integrity metrics  
To offer insight into ongoing and closed cases, 
multiple real-time and quarterly Investigation 
Dashboards are made available to the appropri­
ate stakeholders 
In 2023, our trust and engagement KPIs were 
as follows:
Trust KPI – the rate of severity level 1 and 2 
investigations where the reporters disclosed 
their identity: 60 percent as compared to 
60 percent in the period 2021–2022  
Engagement KPI – the volume of unique vis­
itors on the Integrity Awareness Portal for 
integrity learnings: 80 percent of employ­
ees, as compared to 70 percent in the period 
2021–2022 
CASE STUDY
PROCESS AUTOMATION 
How Process Automation makes integrity part of its daily operations
ABB’s principles of integrity and transparency apply across the entire 
Group  Our business areas and divisions take active ownership and re­
sponsibility for integrity in their daily business  In Process Automation, 
our commitment to integrity is a cornerstone of our business agenda  We 
continuously implement activities throughout the organization to further 
drive a culture of integrity in everything we do  For example, in 2023, we 
launched a monthly internal update highlighting key milestones in our in­
tegrity and transparency journey  In addition, we hosted Integrity Aware­
ness Weeks across our organization, which included a series of discus­
sions covering the topics of the ABB Code of Conduct  
Moreover, as part of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement entered into 
with US authorities on December 2, 2022, ABB has implemented a work 
plan which is based on the elements of a Corporate Compliance Program, 
as included in DOJ and SEC’s “A Resource Guide to the US Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act”  The work plan includes a component to sustainably imple­
ment integrity into daily operations 
As part of our daily operations, we drive cross-functional dialogue and 
collaboration on key integrity topics among our teams, including Legal 
& Integrity, Risk Management, Human Rights and Sustainability  This is 
crucial to ensure alignment on these topics, particularly when working on 
complex projects

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
ABB has a “zero tolerance” policy towards un­
ethical business behavior including any form 
of bribery or corruption  Having a robust 
anti-bribery and anti-corruption control frame­
work and strong ethical culture is essential for 
ensuring that we comply with our legal respon­
sibilities and preserve our license to operate 
Our ABAC training program centers on the up­
skilling of employees in gatekeeper functions 
and customer facing roles across ABB  The 
ABAC training program aims to enhance core 
ABAC competencies while highlighting the crit­
ical role these individuals play in upholding our 
integrity culture and compliance obligations 
Our actions to enhance our culture of integrity 
continue to focus on: 
•	 remediating the root causes of misconduct, 
firstly through internal control enhancements 
at the local level where they occurred, and sec­
ondly through global process enhancements; 
•	 applying learnings to drive company-wide cul­
tural changes and individual accountability 
for integrity;
•	 innovating ABB’s monitoring and testing activ­
ities and the platforms/tools we use for strong 
risk management and integrity assurance, in­
cluding our continuous monitoring platform, 
aimed at attempting to detect ABAC and fraud 
risks by leveraging risk algorithms as applied 
to company data points across many com­
pany systems 
In 2023, we enhanced and innovated a number 
of company policies and procedures to fur­
ther mitigate ABAC risks  We completed the 
first year of our Deferred Prosecution Agree­
ment (DPA) with the United States Department 
of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) pursuant to a rigorous work­
plan focused on these enhancements and inno­
vations  Under the DPA, for a three-year period, 
we will self-report on continual enhancements 
to our integrity program to ensure that our con­
trols, processes and culture serve as effective 
deterrents to bribery and corruption 
Our integrity program goes beyond ABAC and 
workplace behavior and includes trade and anti­
trust as well as data privacy and cyber security

ABB’s antitrust compliance program is guided 
by a suite of guidance notes, procedures and 
internal controls specifically addressing ABB’s 
global antitrust risks  These are integrated into 
ABB’s culture and internal controls through 
dedicated training of legal and business com­
munities, the provision of specific expert anti­
trust advice as well as regular internal exchange 
forums to raise awareness of antitrust topics 
of relevance to our operations  Our antitrust 
experts work closely with our colleagues from 
ABB’s business ethics helpline to facilitate the 
identification, investigation and remediation 
of any antitrust concerns  Importantly, a strong 
antitrust ethos permeates ABB’s mergers & 
acquisitions activities, including through the 
performance of due diligence prior to invest­
ments, acquisitions or joint ventures, to sup­
port healthy and compliant company growth 
We ensure the protection of customer, em­
ployee and other individual privacy and per­
sonal data, and implement robust measures 
to protect their rights and safeguard against 
cyber threats  Respecting the right to data pro­
tection is a priority for us and we have adopted 
global data protection standards to ensure a 
high, standardized level of protection for per­
sonal data  We monitor and review compliance 
with ABB’s data protection policies and appli­
cable data protection laws, by means of data 
protection audits, assessments and other con­
trols  All ABB employees are made aware of the 
basics of data privacy, and specialized training 
is provided for selected job functions  
At ABB, we are committed to a culture of eth­
ics and transparency and encourage our people 
to speak up  We offer multiple channels for our 
stakeholders to report integrity violations and 
non-compliance with our Code of Conduct  We 
intend to make this process as straightforward 
and seamless as possible  Confidential report­
ing processes are available for both employees 
and our broader community of stakeholders, in­
cluding options for anonymous reporting  Our 
commitment to non-retaliation applies anytime 
someone has raised a potential integrity con­
cern either in good faith or through coopera­
tion in an investigation  
ABB’s business ethics helpline permits web and 
phone reporting and is operated by an indepen­
dent service provider, which forwards the re­
port to a dedicated investigations team within 
the Legal & Integrity function at ABB headquar­
ters or, in EU countries where required by law, 
to a local representative of the chosen ABB 
partner company  All reports are subject to ap­
propriate investigation and are brought to full 
closure using systematic processes and track­
ing systems so that due process is followed 
across our internal investigations  An employee 
or stakeholder who files a report can follow-up 
on the status of their report and continue to 
engage with the ABB investigator using a per­
sonal PIN  The helpline permits reporting on 
conduct relating to all aspects of the ABB Code 
of Conduct, including corruption, fraud, trade 
compliance, antitrust, data privacy, workplace 
behavior, human rights, environment, occupa­
tional health and safety violations, workplace 
violence, and more

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
Cases reported in 2023
We have seen an increase in total concerns re­
ported to our business ethics helpline since 
2022  We attribute this to an increased confi­
dence in our reporting and allegation manage­
ment processes coupled with more in-person 
interactions in the wake of the pandemic  In 
2023, the allegations reported were structured 
into the following categories (as well as more 
detailed subcategories within each of these) to 
ensure appropriate attention, resourcing and 
internal escalation:
•	 Antitrust & Fair Competition
•	 Bribery benefiting ABB
•	 Commercial integrity & Regulatory
•	 Fraud: Non-Self-Dealing
•	 Fraud: Self-Dealing
•	 HSE & Security
•	 Human Resources
•	 Non-Integrity Issue
•	 Other Integrity Issue The following table provides an overview of 
number of allegations related to integrity 
concerns and employment actions – in ad­
dition to myriad, non-disciplinary remedial 
actions – resulting from integrity violations 
pursuant to ABB’s root-cause analysis and 
accountability processes:

Responsible sourcing 
Our Supplier Code of Conduct makes clear that 
all third parties with which we do business are 
expected to adhere to the same ethical stan­
dards as ABB  In November 2023, we published 
an updated edition of the Supplier Code of Con­
duct along with an implementation guide to 
address the latest relevant international frame­
works, standards and legislation governing 
ethical and sustainable business practices  To 
prevent human rights violations in our supply 
chain, we substantively revised the section on 
“Human rights and decent work” in our Supplier 
Code and included more specific requirements 
regarding modern slavery, discrimination and 
diversity, as well as the rights of local com­
munities and vulnerable groups  Furthermore, 
a section on “Climate and environment” was 
added to reflect our intensified efforts to miti­
gate climate change  We have expanded the list 
of potential environmental impacts to include 
topics of growing interest to our stakeholders, 
such as GHG emissions, circularity, biodiversity 
and deforestation  The updated Supplier Code 
explicitly requires suppliers to disseminate and 
enforce these requirements across their own 
supply chains and to report any suspected vio­
lations  We provided ABB personnel with train­
ing sessions on the updated Supplier Code in 
2023 and will start trainings for our suppliers 
on these updates in 2024  
We use our “Third Party Management” pro­
gram to assess and manage risks as well as to 
onboard and monitor engagement with third 
parties across the entire value chain, including 
upstream (suppliers) and downstream (sales)  It 
involves the following elements:
As part of our Sustainable Supply Base Manage­
ment (SSBM) program, we assess suppliers for 
their sustainability performance every year and 
mitigate risks identified  This involves a sup­
plier self-assessment during the onboarding 
process, and subsequent further due diligence 
in case of high-risk scores, including mandatory 
onsite audits in focus countries  In 2023, we 
adjusted the SSBM Country Specific Protocol 
to permit audits of temporary labor suppliers  
Several pilots have already been deployed and 
the resolution of identified cases related to 
labor law violations is under way  At the end of 
2023, 42 percent of our spending on high-risk 
suppliers in focus countries was covered by our 
SSBM program, and 88 percent of identified 
risks were closed 
Risk-based front-

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
OUTPUTS AND OUTCOMES
Conflict minerals and child labor
Our ABB Way operating model requires that all 
materials intended for our products and ser­
vices are sourced and procured ethically  ABB is 
a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative 
and commits to sourcing minerals and metals 
responsibly, as described in the ABB Policy on 
Conflict Minerals  We have established a “Con­
flict Minerals Compliance Program” based on 
the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Respon­
sible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict 
Affected and High-Risk Areas and other appro­
priate international standards  ABB does not 
source from smelters and refiners in conflict af­
fected or high-risk areas (CAHRAs) unless they 
have implemented OECD aligned programs  
Every year, we file a Conflict Minerals Report 
with the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC)  Last year, we extended our 
Conflict Minerals program beyond 3TG (Tin, 
Tungsten, Tantalum and Gold) to include Co­
balt  Due diligence on further minerals will con­
tinue in 2024  
In response to the new requirements estab­
lished by Art  964j–l of the Swiss Code of Ob­
ligations and the Swiss Ordinance on Due 
Diligence and Transparency in relation to Min­
erals and Metals from Conflict-Affected Areas 
and Child Labour (DDTrO), we have assessed 
our respective risk exposure and reached the 
following conclusions:
•	 The quantities of minerals and metals in 
scope of the aforementioned regulations 
which ABB imported into or processed in 
Switzerland in 2023 are substantially below 
applicable thresholds  Hence, ABB is ex­
empted from specific due diligence and re­
porting obligations under the DDTrO in re­
gard to conflict minerals 
•	 No cases of child labor came to light in our 
analyses of our global supply chains in 2023 
and nor was there any reason to suspect that 
we caused or contributed to the use of child 
labor either in our own operations, or in our 
direct suppliers’ operations, as was the case 
in previous years  In 2023, we again assessed 
our human rights processes and policies and 
identified areas of improvement  This led to 
the updating of our Supplier Code of Conduct 
and Human Rights Policy as well as our Human 
Rights Due Diligence framework  We are now 
compliant with ILO Conventions 138 and 182 
as well as the ILO-IOE Child Labour Guidance 
Tool for Business of December 15, 2015, and 
the UN Guiding Principles on Business and 
Human Rights  The aforementioned frame­
works and standards include those which the 
DDTrO specifies as internationally recognized 
equivalent regulations for child labor  As a re­
sult of our compliance with these frameworks 
and standards, we are exempted from specific 
due diligence and reporting obligations under 
the DDTrO in regard to child labor 
OUTLOOK
Integrity and transparency are the foundations of our Sustainability Agenda  
In 2024, we will further strengthen our approach and focus in particular on the following 
initiatives:
•	 After updating our Code of Conduct and Human Rights Policy in 2023, we will drive imple­
mentation and listen to signals  
•	 Conduct in-depth trainings on specific topics such as modern slavery and child labor 
•	 Enhance due diligence incorporating further minerals 
•	 Using our human rights roadmap, we will investigate technological solutions and artificial 
intelligence to strengthen the risk mapping of our value chains

Corporate governance
ABB is committed to the highest international stan­
dards of corporate governance  This is reinforced 
in its structure, processes and rules, as outlined in 
more detail in ABB’s Corporate Governance Report 
ABB complies with all relevant frameworks, 
including the Swiss Code of Obligations, the 
Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Gov­
ernance and the rules of the capital markets 
where its shares are listed  Governance princi­
ples are also anchored in various ABB corporate 
documents, such as its Articles of Incorpora­
tion, its Board Governance Rules and its poli­
cies and procedures 
Strong corporate governance is not only neces­
sary to ensure compliance with applicable legal 
requirements but is indispensable for creat­
ing sustainable value  We are convinced that 
our established governance culture helps ABB 
successfully manage its business and realize 
opportunities for the benefit of all of its share­
holders  This applies in particular to sustain­
ability  ABB has a robust sustainability gover­
nance structure from its Board of Directors 
through to its operating divisions

Board of Directors
ABB’s Board of Directors is responsible for the strategy 
of the company  It is a truly diverse board: seven of its 
ten members have been elected in the past eight years 
and all of them represent a broad variety of geographical, 
business, management and cultural experience 
While the Board takes decisions as a whole, 
its three committees – the Finance, Audit and 
Compliance Committee, the Governance and 
Nomination Committee and the Compensation 
Committee – support it with high-level exper­
tise and by ensuring an efficient mode of oper­
ation  Special attention is paid to sustainabil­
ity aspects: oversight of ABB’s Sustainability 
Agenda (including corporate social responsi­
bility, health, safety and environment) is the 
responsibility of the Governance and Nomina­
tion Committee, while the Compensation Com­
mittee ensures that ABB’s executive compen­
sation policies are appropriately aligned to its 
Sustainability Agenda  Ultimate responsibility 
for ABB’s Sustainability Agenda, its sustainabil­
ity targets and its annual Sustainability Report 
lies with the entire Board of Directors

Sustainability-related considera­
tions in ABB’s compensation
Extracts from Compensation 
Committee Chair Letter
Our focus at the Compensation Committee remains to ensure 
that the compensation structure at ABB drives value creation for 
our shareholders, represents a motivating package for our ex­
ecutives, and ensures alignment with best-practice corporate 
governance standards and with ABB’s Sustainability Agenda 
In response to valuable feedback from our 
stakeholders, you will find the 2023 Annual In­
centive Plan (AIP) targets for the CEO disclosed 
in ABB’s Compensation Report 2023, providing 
additional level of transparency on the align­
ment between pay and performance that we 
seek to ensure at ABB 
Furthermore, we will extend our malus and 
clawback policy, which is currently applied to 
our Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) with a claw­
back period of five years, to future AIP launches 
(i e , from 2024) for all EC members, with a 
clawback period of three years, in line with 
market practice 
Finally, we have introduced an additional dis­
closure – the ratio of the annual total compen­
sation of our CEO to the median annual total 
compensation of all permanent ABB employees 
in Switzerland  Details can be found in the sec­
tion “Annual total compensation ratio” of ABB’s 
Compensation Report 2023 
We will maintain the strong link between our 
Sustainability Agenda and compensation pro­
grams, such that all EC members continue to 
have a sustainability performance measure in 
their LTIP, with a material weighting of 20 per­
cent  Details related to the sustainability target 
for the 2024 LTIP are disclosed in ABB’s Com­
pensation Report 2023 
In addition, all EC members shall have two or 
more goals relating to sustainability in the indi­
vidual component of their AIP

2023 was a year of solid operational and finan­
cial performance  Overall, most key financial, 
sustainability and operational targets were 
met or excelled  ABB (the Company) delivered a 
strong operational EBITA margin, increased its 
revenues, and improved productivity in 2023  
The Company also made significant progress in 
reducing its environmental footprint and con­
tributing to a more sustainable environment

ability achievements please refer to sections

Board of Directors (Board)
The aggregate Board compensation for the 
2023–2024 term (CHF 4 38 million) is in line 
with the maximum amount (CHF 4 4 million) 
approved at the 2023 Annual General Meeting 
(AGM)  There has been no change to the individ­
ual Board member fees since 2015 
Executive Committee 
The aggregate EC total compensation was CHF 
40 6 million in 2023, driven largely by the strong 
performance related variable pay awards  This 
is below the maximum amount (CHF 45 9 mil­
lion) approved at the 2022 AGM  Two of the nine 
EC members in place received a salary adjust­
ment in March 2023, which ranged from 3 6 to 
8 3 percent, for exceptional performance and or 
broadened responsibilities  This corresponded 
to an average 1 3 percent increase on the an­
nual aggregate base salaries for EC members in 
post in March 2023  The average award for the 
current EC members under the AIP for 2023 was 
143 3 percent (out of a maximum of 150 per­
cent), compared to 118 3 percent in 2022  The 
average weighted achievement level of the 2020 
LTIP, which vested in 2023, was 189 5 percent 
(out of a maximum of 200 percent), driven by 
solid evolution of our Earnings Per Share (EPS) 
during the period, and a maximum vesting un­
der the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance measure 
At the AGM on March 21, 2024, shareholders will 
be asked to vote on the maximum aggregate 
compensation for the Board for its 2024–2025 
term and on the maximum aggregate compen­
sation for the EC in 2025  The former is again 
unchanged compared to the prior year, while 
the latter shows an increase from the level re­
quested for the prior year, primarily influenced 
by the change in composition of the EC 
The Compensation Report 2023 will also be 
submitted for a non-binding, consultative vote 
by shareholders  We have pursued an open 
and regular dialogue with our stakeholders, 
as we continue to improve our compensation 
system  On behalf of the Compensation Com­
mittee, I thank all shareholders for their con­
tinued trust in ABB and for their consistently 
supportive feedback

PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION
Considering the stated variable components 
above, the realized total compensation in 2023 
was above the target total compensation for 
all EC members, driven by strong performance 
in 2023 and the high level of achievement 
against the targets for the 2020 LTIP, which 
vested in 2023

Sustainability-related considerations 
in ABB’s compensation
There are a range of sustainability-related considerations which play an 
­
important role in our compensation philosophy, including the desire to 
foster a strong link between ABB’s Sustainability Agenda and the vari­
able compensation for the EC and senior management, as well as the 
­
general ambition to reinforce its social contract with its employees 
Given sustainability is an integral part of ABB’s 
strategy and plans, there is a strong, direct link 
between the Sustainability Agenda and execu­
tive incentives through ABB’s key variable com­
pensation programs such as AIP and LTIP  
Regarding the AIP, all EC members have two or 
three sustainability goals (out of a maximum 
of three) in the individual component of their 
respective plans  
In 2023, all EC members had an environmental 
goal (scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emis­
sions reduction)  Most of the EC members had 
a social goal, which for the CEO and business 
area presidents was safety, and for most corpo­
rate officers was an increase in the proportion 
of women in senior management roles (female 
leaders), while the CFO had a governance goal 
(related to internal controls) 
In addition, all EC members had an integrity 
goal designed to help deliver ABB’s obligations 
under the Deferred Prosecution Agreement 
(DPA) in line with our commitments to the US 
Department of Justice 
Regarding the LTIP granted to ABB’s senior 
management in 2023, including the EC, a Com­
pany-wide sustainability performance measure 
with a weighting of 20 percent forms part of 
the performance measures 
•	 For the 2023 LTIP, the sustainability perfor­
mance measure was the Company’s GHG 
emissions reduction at the end of the three-
year performance period (2023–2025), com­
pared to the 2019 baseline  
•	 To support our strong ambition to our long-
term GHG emissions reduction, the sustain­
ability measure for the 2024 LTIP will again be 
GHG emissions reduction at the end of the 
three-year performance period (2024–2026), 
compared to the 2019 baseline 
Details of the long-term GHG emissions reduc­
tion targets can be found in ABB’s Sustainabil­
ity Report 2023

PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION
In addition to the offer of fair and competi­
tive compensation to our employees, ABB also 
strives to offer additional programs to rein­
force its social contract with its employees  
Selected key programs and their links to our 
Sustainability Agenda are summarized in the 
Exhibit 8 below 
Program
Operation and purpose
Link to ABB’s Sustainability Agenda
Employee Share 
Acquisition Plan 
(ESAP)
Offered to ca  100,000 employees in over 60 coun­
tries, providing the opportunity to purchase 
shares in ABB one year after the start of a plan, at 
a price which will be fixed at the beginning of each

The opportunity for share ownership is the same 
for permanent full-time and permanent part-time 
employees at ABB  This is the case in all ABB loca­
tions where ESAP is offered 
Supports social goals by aligning employees’ in­
terests with the interests of shareholders and 
maintaining focus on the long-term success of 
the Company 
Parental Leave
A global and gender-neutral program, offered to 
all employees, which sets out a minimum stan­
dard on paid parental leave that supports all fam­
ily types  The primary caregivers receive 12 weeks 
of paid leave and the secondary caregivers four 
weeks following the birth of a child or when be­
coming a new parent by adoption or surrogacy 
Supports social goals, promotes wellbeing and 
the ABB value of “Care” 
Employee 
Assistance
A global program, offered to all employees  The 
program supports the employee’s wellbeing by 
offering paid counseling on emotional health, 
family concerns and workplace concerns 
Supports social goals, promotes wellbeing and 
the ABB value of “Care”

EU Taxonomy 
disclosures summary
At ABB, we are determined to shape our future 
in an environmentally sustainable way by in­
vesting in environmentally sustainable activ­
ities  The European Union (EU) has taken the 
lead in standardizing sustainability-related 
data and defining criteria for environmental 
sustainability  As part of the European Green 
Deal, the EU aims to become climate-neutral 
and to reduce GHG emissions to net zero by 
2050  With the Action Plan on Financing Sus­
tainable Growth, the European Commission 
intends to reorient the European economic and 
financial system towards more sustainable 
technologies and businesses  The EU Taxonomy 
is the cornerstone of the EU’s Green Deal and 
Sustainable Finance Action Plan, as it aims to 
direct capital flows specifically into sustainable 
projects and companies  
The EU Taxonomy is a classification sys­
tem for economic activities that are envi­
ronmentally sustainable  It establishes six 
environmental objectives: 
•	 Climate change mitigation
•	 Climate change adaptation
•	 Sustainable use and protection of water and 
marine resources
•	 Transition to a circular economy
•	 Pollution prevention and control
•	 Protection and restoration of biodiversity 
and ecosystems 
The EU Taxonomy distinguishes between 
«Taxonomy-eligible» and «Taxonomy-aligned» 
economic activities  
An economic activity is considered «eligible» 
if it is described in the adopted Delegated 
Acts, whereas an eligible activity is only con­
sidered environmentally sustainable and thus 
«aligned», if it meets the following conditions:
•	 Makes a substantial contribution to one of 
the environmental objectives by complying 
with the substantial contribution criteria de­
fined for the activity;
•	 Meets the “Do No Significant Harm” criteria, 
having no negative effect on any of the other 
five environmental objectives;
•	 Complies with the minimum safeguards re­
lated primarily to human rights and social and 
labor standards 
How ABB adopted the EU Taxonomy
Year
Progress in adopting the EU Taxonomy
2021
We conducted a first eligibility analysis of our 
products, sites and activities and reviewed them 
against the economic activities defined by the 
Taxonomy in all the countries in which we oper­
ate  We involved the expertise of our product 
managers, real estate managers, sustainability 
managers, financial controllers, R&D controllers, 
and environmental managers across all levels of 
our organization and solicited advice from 
external consultants 
2022
Relevant Taxonomy-aligned activities were identi­
fied across the Group, with alignment results pub­
lished for the first time 
2023 A thorough review was conducted in 2023 to ac­
commodate the changes introduced by the new 
Taxonomy activities that were added in 2023 and 
amended DNSH criteria 
Economic activities of ABB in the context of 
the EU Taxonomy 
Most of our eligible products and services are 
considered “enabling activities”, as defined by 
the Taxonomy Regulation,1 meaning economic 
activities that “directly enable other activities 
to make a substantial contribution” to one of 
the environmental objectives 
A selection of our activities in Electrification, 
Motion, Process Automation and Robotics & 
Discrete Automation business areas, together 
with our Real Estate activities, are eligible to 
contribute to the environmental objective of 
climate change mitigation  In addition, some of 
our activities are eligible under the environmen­
tal objective of transition to a circular economy  
The full regulatory disclosure of ABB’s Tax­
onomy-eligible and -aligned activities can 
be found in the EU Taxonomy section of our 
­
Sustainability Report 2023  
1	 
According to Article 16 of 
Regulation (EU) 2020/852, 
an economic activity shall 
qualify as contributing sub­
stantially to one or more of 
the environmental objectives 
“by directly enabling other 
activities to make a substan­
tial contribution to one or 
more of those objectives, 
provided that such economic 
activity: (a) does not lead to 
a lock-in of assets that un­
dermine long-term environ­
mental goals, considering the 
economic lifetime of those 
assets; and (b) has a sub­
stantial positive environmen­
tal impact, on the basis of 
lifecycle considerations ”

The EU Taxonomy requires the disclosure of 
the amounts of eligible and aligned activities 
in three KPIs: turnover, capital expenditure 
(CapEx), and operating expenditure (Opex)  
In 2023, 46% of ABB revenues were Taxonomy-­
eligible, out of which 6% were Taxonomy-­
aligned  A more detailed breakdown is offered 
in the chart below 
It is noted that changes may be made to the 
lists of our economic activities in the future, as 
the rules around the Taxonomy evolve  Addition­
ally, wording and terminology used in the EU 
Taxonomy are still subject to some uncertainty 
in interpretation, which may lead to changes in 
subsequent reporting once clarifications would 
be provided by the EU  For more details on our

ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
APPENDIX
Alternative performance 
measures
The following are definitions of key financial 
measures used to evaluate ABB’s operating 
performance  These financial measures are 
referred to in this Annual Report and are not 
defined under United States generally accepted 
accounting principles (US GAAP)  
While ABB’s management believes that the 
non‑GAAP financial measures herein are useful 
in evaluating ABB’s operating results, this infor­
mation should be considered as supplemental 
in nature and not as a substitute for the related 
financial information prepared in accordance 
with US GAAP  
COMPARABLE GROWTH RATES 
Growth rates for certain key figures may be pre­
sented and discussed on a “comparable” basis  
The comparable growth rate measures growth 
on a constant currency basis  Since we are a 
global company, the comparability of our oper­
ating results reported in US dollars is affected 
by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  
We calculate the impacts from foreign currency 
fluctuations by translating the current‑year 
periods’ reported key figures into US dollar 
amounts using the exchange rates in effect for 
the comparable periods in the previous year  
Comparable growth rates are also adjusted for 
changes in our business portfolio  Adjustments 
to our business portfolio occur due to acquisi­
tions, divestments, or by exiting specific busi­
ness activities or customer markets  The ad­
justment for portfolio changes is calculated as 
follows: where the results of any business ac­
quired or divested have not been consolidated 
and reported for the entire duration of both the 
current and comparable periods, the reported 
key figures of such business are adjusted to ex­
clude the relevant key figures of any correspond­
ing quarters which are not comparable when 
computing the comparable growth rate  Certain 
portfolio changes which do not qualify as di­
vestments under US GAAP have been treated in 
a similar manner to divestments  Changes in our 
portfolio where we have exited certain business 
activities or customer markets are adjusted as 
if the relevant business was divested in the pe­
riod when the decision to cease business activ­
ities was taken  We do not adjust for portfolio 
changes where the relevant business has annu­
alized revenues of less than $50 million 
OPERATIONAL EBITA MARGIN 
Operational EBITA margin 
Operational EBITA margin is operational EBITA 
as a percentage of operational revenues  
Operational EBITA 
Operational earnings before interest, taxes 
and acquisition‑related amortization (op­
erational EBITA) represents income from 
operations excluding: 
•	 acquisition‑related amortization (as de­
fined below), 
•	 restructuring, related and implementation 
costs (as defined below), 
•	 changes in the amount recorded for obliga­
tions related to divested businesses occur­
ring after the divestment date (changes in 
­
obligations related to divested businesses), 
•	 gains and losses from sale of businesses (in­
cluding fair value adjustment on assets and 
­
liabilities held for sale, if any), 
•	 acquisition‑ and divestment‑related expenses 
and integration costs, 
•	 certain other non‑operational items, as well as 
•	 foreign exchange/commodity timing differ­
ences in income from operations consisting 
of: (a) unrealized gains and losses on deriva­
tives (foreign exchange, commodities, em­
bedded derivatives), (b) realized gains and 
losses on derivatives where the underlying 
hedged transaction has not yet been realized, 
and (c) unrealized foreign exchange move­
ments on receivables/ payables (and related 
assets/liabilities)  Certain other non‑operational items generally 
includes: certain regulatory, compliance and 
legal costs, certain asset write downs/impair­
ments and certain other fair value changes, 
changes in estimates relating to opening bal­
ance sheets of acquired businesses (changes

in pre‑acquisition estimates), as well as other 
items which are determined by management on 
a case‑by‑case basis  
Operational EBITA is our measure of segment 
profit but is also used by management to evalu­
ate the profitability of the company as a whole  
Acquisition-related amortization 
Amortization expense on intangibles arising 
upon acquisitions  
Restructuring, related and implementa­
tion costs consists of restructuring and other 
related expenses, as well as internal and ex­
ternal costs relating to the implementation of 
Group-wide restructuring programs  
Operational revenues 
We present operational revenues solely for the 
purpose of allowing the computation of the 
operational EBITA margin  Operational reve­
nues are total revenues adjusted for foreign 
exchange/commodity timing differences in to­
tal revenues of: (i) unrealized gains and losses 
on derivatives, (ii) realized gains and losses on 
derivatives where the underlying hedged trans­
action has not yet been realized, and (iii) unre­
alized foreign exchange movements on receiv­
ables (and related assets)  Operational revenues 
are not intended to be an alternative measure 
to total revenues, which represent our revenues 
measured in accordance with US GAAP  
NET WORKING CAPITAL AS A 
PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES 
Net working capital as a percentage of reve­
nues is calculated as net working capital divided 
by adjusted revenues for the trailing 12 months  
Net working capital is the sum of (i) receiv­
ables, net, (ii) contract assets, (iii) inventories, 
net, and (iv) prepaid expenses; less (v) accounts 
payable, trade, (vi) contract liabilities and 
(vii) other current liabilities (excluding primar­
ily: (a) income taxes payable, (b) current deriv­
ative liabilities, (c) pension and other employee 
benefits, (d) payables under the share buyback 
program, (e) liabilities related to certain other 
restructuring-related activities and (f) liabil­
ities related to the divestment of the Power 
Grids business); and including the amounts 
related to these accounts which have been 
presented as either assets or liabilities held 
for sale but excluding any amounts included in 
discontinued operations  
Adjusted revenues for the trailing 12 months 
includes total revenues recorded by ABB in 
the 12 months preceding the relevant balance 
sheet date adjusted to eliminate revenues of 
divested businesses and the estimated impact 
of annualizing revenues of certain acquisitions 
which were completed in the same trailing 
12-month period  
FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION TO 
NET INCOME 
Free cash flow conversion to net income is cal­
culated as free cash flow divided by adjusted 
net income attributable to ABB  
Adjusted net income attributable to ABB 
is calculated as net income attributable to 
ABB adjusted for: (i) impairment of goodwill, 
(ii) losses from extinguishment of debt, and 
(iii) gains arising on the sale of the Power Con­
version division, the equity-accounted invest­
ment in Hitachi Energy Ltd , and the Power 
Grids business, the latter being included in 
discontinued operations  
Free cash flow is calculated as net cash pro­
vided by operating activities adjusted for: 
(i) purchases of property, plant and equipment 
and intangible assets, and (ii) proceeds from 
sales of property, plant and equipment  
RETURN ON CAPITAL EMPLOYED 
Return on capital employed (ROCE) is calcu­
lated as operational EBITA after tax, divided by 
the average of the period’s opening and closing 
capital employed, adjusted to reflect impacts 
from the timing of significant acquisitions/di­
vestments occurring during the period  
Capital employed is calculated as the sum of 
adjusted total fixed assets and net working 
capital (as defined above)  
Adjusted total fixed assets is the sum 
of (i) property, plant and equipment, net, 
(ii) ­
goodwill, (iii) other intangible assets, net, 
(iv) investments in equity-accounted compa­
nies, and (v) operating lease right of-use assets, 
less (vi) deferred tax liabilities recognized in 
certain acquisitions  
Notional tax on operational EBITA is computed 
using an adjusted group effective tax rate mul­
tiplied by operational EBITA  
104
ABB INTEGRATED REPORT 2023 
APPENDIX
Adjusted Group effective tax rate is computed 
by dividing an adjusted income tax expense by 
an adjusted pretax income  Certain amounts re­
corded in income before taxes and the related 
income tax expense (primarily due to gains 
and losses from sale of businesses and in 2022, 
regulatory penalties in connection with the 
Kusile project) are removed from the reported 
amounts when computing these adjusted 
amounts  Certain other amounts recorded in 
income tax expense are also excluded from the 
computation to determine the adjusted Group 
effective tax rate  
NET DEBT 
Net debt is defined as total debt less cash and 
marketable securities  
Total debt is the sum of short-term debt and 
current maturities of long-term debt, and long-
term debt  
Cash and marketable securities is the sum of 
cash and equivalents, restricted cash (current 
and non-current) and marketable securities and 
short-term investments  
NET DEBT/EBITDA RATIO 
Net debt/EBITDA ratio is defined as net debt 
(as defined above) divided by EBITDA  
EBITDA is defined as income from operations 
for the trailing 12 months preceding the bal­
ance sheet date before depreciation and amor­
tization for the same trailing 12-month period  
NET FINANCE EXPENSES 
Net finance expenses is calculated as interest 
and dividend income less interest and other 
finance expense  
BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO 
Book-to-bill ratio is calculated as orders re­
ceived divided by total revenues

Key terms
A 
ABB Way 
The ABB Way is the common operat­
ing model for our divisions, business 
areas and lean corporate center  It de­
fines “how” we create value  It is built 
around our purpose and consists of 
four elements: business model, gover­
nance, people & culture and brand 
B
Business areas 
ABB has a decentralized business 
model with 19 divisions grouped into 
four business areas: Electrification, Mo­
tion, Process Automation, and Robotics 
& Discrete Automation  They comple­
ment each other, cooperate and find 
synergies to create competitive advan­
tages and best serve our customers 
C
Circular economy 
In contrast to a linear “take-make-
waste” model of production and con­
sumption, the circular economy aims 
to keep resources in use by designing 
products for durability, reusability and 
recyclability  At ABB, circular economy 
approaches are at the center of the sec­
ond pillar of our Sustainability Agenda, 
“preserving resources”  By 2030, we 
aim to have at least 80 percent of ABB’s 
products and solutions covered by our 
Circularity Approach and evaluated 
against a clear set of key performance 
indicators (KPIs), corresponding to 
each stage of the product lifecycle 
D
Divisions
Our 19 divisions represent the highest 
level of operating decisions within ABB 
with full ownership and accountability 
for their respective strategies, perfor­
mance and resources, as they are clos­
est to our markets and customers  They 
are grouped into four business areas 
G
Greenhouse gas emissions 
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
emissions refer to all emissions that 
have a warming effect on the earth’s 
surface by trapping heat in the atmo­
sphere  The Greenhouse Gas ­
Protocol, 
which sets global standards to mea­
sure and manage GHG emissions, 
covers seven GHGs: carbon dioxide 
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide 
(N2O), as well as gases used in indus­
try, including hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), per-fluorocarbons (PCFs), 
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)  and nitro­
gen trifluoride (NF3)  CO2, CH4, and 
N2O are released during the combus­
tion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, or 
natural gas  All GHG emissions can be 
calculated as CO2-equivalents (CO2e), 
which is the metric measure used at 
ABB to calculate our overall emissions 
and progress towards our emissions 
reduction targets 
H
Headcount vs  FTE
Headcount and FTE (full-time equiva­
lent) are both methods that are used 
to count members within an organiza­
tion  The key difference is that head­
count represents the total number of 
employees that are working at an orga­
nization at any given time, regardless 
of their work status being full-time or 
part-time  It is mainly used in social 
reporting  While FTE is a metric that is 
notably used in financial reporting to 
calculate the total number of full-time 
hours being collectively worked across 
an organization, this way making em­
ployed persons comparable although 
they may work a different number of 
hours per week  For example, if an or­
ganization considers 40 hours per week 
as full-time, a part-time worker em­
ployed for 20 hours a week, is counted 
as 0 5 FTE or as 1 headcount 
M
Materiality/material topics 
Materiality refers to the process of 
identifying the most important top­
ics to be managed and included in re­
porting  ABB’s material sustainability 
topics were identified in 2020 through 
a comprehensive stakeholder engage­
ment process and updated with a 
double materiality lens in 2023  Based 
on this analysis, we present an over­
view of material topics for value cre­
ation in the chapter “Material topics”, 
reflecting both the impact that ABB 
has on the economy, environment and 
society including people, and the im­
pact that sustainability has on ABB’s 
business success 
N
Net zero versus carbon neutral 
“Net zero” means that any GHG re­
leased into the atmosphere is bal­
anced by an equivalent amount being 
removed  “Carbon neutral” means that 
carbon emissions can be offset by a 
reduction in emissions or a removal 
of carbon from the atmosphere, for 
instance through carbon sinks, which 
absorb more carbon than they emit  
At ABB, we have established net-zero

targets  By 2050, ABB targets reduc­
ing absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions 
by 100 percent, and scope 3 emissions 
by 90 percent 
P
Purpose
ABB’s purpose is to enable a more sus­
tainable and resource-efficient future 
with our technology leadership in elec­
trification and automation  This is why 
we are in business and is the guiding 
star for ABB’s direction and strategy  
Our purpose is based on five themes: 
creating success for all our stakehold­
ers, addressing the world’s energy 
challenges, transforming industries, 
embedding sustainability in everything 
we do, and leading with technology 
S
Science-based targets
Greenhouse gas reduction targets, set 
by companies, that are in line with what 
the latest climate science deems nec­
essary to meet the goals of the Paris 
Agreement, which aims to limit “the 
increase in the average global tempera­
ture to well below 2 °C above pre-indus­
trial levels” and “pursue efforts to limit 
the temperature increase to 1 5 °C ”
Scope 1 GHG emissions
Direct emissions from compa­
ny-owned and controlled resources, ­
­
for example, emissions from combus­
tion in owned or controlled boilers, 
­
furnaces, vehicles 
Scope 2 GHG emissions 
Indirect emissions from the generation 
of purchased energy (electricity, steam, 
heat, cooling) from a utility provider 
Scope 3 GHG emissions 
All other indirect emissions that are 
not included in scope 2, occurring in 
both the upstream and downstream 
value chain  According to the GHG Pro­
tocol, scope 3 emissions are separated 
into 15 categories, and include, for ex­
ample, purchased goods and services, 
business travel and commuting, or use 
of sold products 
Sustainability 
Sustainability or sustainable develop­
ment can be defined as “meeting the 
needs of the present without compro­
mising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs” (Brundtland 
Report, 1987)  Sustainability is com­
monly based on three dimensions: eco­
nomic sustainability, environmental 
sustainability and social sustainability  
At ABB, we strive to embed sustain­
ability in everything we do  Sustainabil­
ity is core to our company’s purpose, 
strategic direction, operating model 
(the ABB Way), objectives, and is a key 
part of the value that we create for 
our stakeholders 
Sustainability Agenda 
In 2020, ABB defined a clear approach 
to contribute to a more sustainable so­
ciety  The three pillars of our Sustain­
ability Agenda are “enabling a low-car­
bon society”, “preserving resources” 
and “promoting social progress”, sus­
tained by the foundation of “embed­
ding a culture of integrity and transpar­
ency along the extended value chain” 
V
Value creation
The process that results in increases, 
decreases or transformations of inputs 
and related outputs and outcomes 
caused by our business activities in 
the-, medium- and long-term  We not 
only focus on maximizing shareholder 
value but work holistically to create fi­
nancial and sustainability-linked value 
for all our stakeholders, for ABB, soci­
ety and the environment  We are con­
vinced that this is not only the right 
thing to do, but also in the interest of 
our long-term business success

Caution concerning forward-looking statements 
The Integrated Report 2023 includes “forward-looking statements” 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and 
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  We have based 
these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations, 
estimates and projections about the factors that may affect our fu­
ture performance, including global economic conditions as well as 
the economic conditions of the regions and the industries that are 
major markets for ABB  The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “esti­
mate,” “continue,” “target,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan” 
and similar words and the express or implied discussion of strat­
egy, plans or intentions are intended to identify forward-looking 
statements  These forward- looking statements are subject to 
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including among other 
things, the following: (i) business risks related to the global volatile 
economic environment; (ii) costs associated with compliance activ­
ities; (iii) difficulties encountered in operating in emerging mar­
kets; (iv) risks inherent in large, long term projects served by parts 
of our business; (v) the timely development of new products, tech­
nologies, and services that are useful for our customers; (vi) our 
ability to anticipate and react to technological change and evolving 
industry standards in the markets in which we operate; (vii) 
changes in interest rates and fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates; (viii) changes in raw materials prices or limitations of sup­
plies of raw materials; (ix) the weakening or unavailability of our in­
tellectual property rights; (x) industry consolidation resulting in 
more powerful competitors and fewer customers; (xi) effects of 
competition and changes in economic and market conditions in the 
product markets and geographic areas in which we operate; (xii) ef­
fects of, and changes in, laws, regulations, governmental policies, 
taxation, or accounting standards and practices and (xiii) other fac­
tors described in documents that we may furnish from time to time 
with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, including our 
Annual Reports on Form 20-F  Although we believe that the expec­
tations reflected in any such forward-looking statements are based 
on reasonable assumptions, we can give no assurance that they will 
be achieved  We undertake no obligation to update publicly or re­
vise any forward-looking statements because of new information, 
future events or otherwise  In light of these risks and uncertainties, 
the forward-looking information, events and circumstances might 
not occur  Our actual results and performance could differ substan­
tially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements
