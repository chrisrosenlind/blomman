Central role in the value chain
Axfood’s own operations encompass three areas, and the operations in each area are impacted 
by prevailing drivers and market conditions  However, Axfood plays a central role in the entire 
food supply chain and thus also has an impact beyond its own operations 
Axfood’s operations
Axfood’s value chain is comprehensive and 
starts with suppliers in primary production, 
with farming and raising animals, and 
continues with everything from processing 
to packaging  Transports are made by 
suppliers to Axfood’s warehouses 
Each week, Axfood’s various concepts reach

7 AXFOOD ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
In changing times, another successful year for 
Axfood is summarised with high growth, increased 
market share and major strides towards increased 
competitiveness through investments in digitalisa­
tion, automation and the customer offering  Our 
business model remains strong despite significant 
changes in market dynamics and it is clear that more 
people have come to appreciate our concepts and 
offerings  This provides us with excellent conditions 
for continued long-term, profitable and sustainable 
growth  
Historically, food retail has been described as a relatively stable 
market with growth that is largely driven by population growth 
and inflation  But during the last few years, market dynamics have 
largely been affected by several external factors  From the large-
scale drought in 2018 which challenged the entire food supply 
chain, to the pandemic in 2020 which led to disruptions in the 
global supply chain and shifts in demand, and laid the foundation 
for the high inflation that has dominated the global economy in the 
last two years  Additionally, we have seen geopolitical conflicts 
escalate, primarily through the war in Ukraine that began in 2022, 
which has further exacerbated the situation 
The intense inflationary pressure that we have experienced in 
both 2022 and 2023 has led consumers to significantly change their 
purchasing behaviour  Price value and low prices have never been 
more important  This new behaviour requires food retail companies 
like us to constantly develop and adapt our offerings based on pre­
vailing conditions  This is something we have needed to adjust to 
during the last few years, and I can say with confidence that our 
model and structure, with different concepts and businesses work­
ing together, has once again this year proven to be a great asset 
Strong position in changing times and major strides 
towards the customer offering of the future –Strong growth and increased 
market share in stores and 
e-commerce with a large 
inflow of new customers 
to Axfood’s concepts –High rate of expansion with 
the establishment of a total of 
twelve new Group-owned 
stores –First deliveries from the new, 
highly automated logistics 
centre in Bålsta outside 
Stockholm, and completed 
automation solution at the 
new fruit and vegetable 
warehouse in Landskrona –Expanded assortment of 
sustainable and healthy 
products –Continued focus on sustain­
able energy and major invest­
ments in solar power facilities

Key ratios
Increased customer traffic and robust growth
In this changing market, Axfood can look back on a strong year 
with a growth rate twice as high as that of the market  Higher 
­
customer traffic resulted in an increase in operating profit, even 
though we did not fully pass on supplier price increases to con­
sumers  During the year, we also had a great deal of pressure from 
sales campaigns and increased costs for rent and personnel, all 
of which impacted operating profit  Overall for 2023, we report an 
adjusted operating margin in line with the previous year, this in a 
time when new consumer behaviour has led to growing competi­
tion and significantly less profitability for our industry overall 
Strong momentum for Axfood’s concepts
With modern stores, a wide and attractive assortment and the 
ambition of providing Sweden’s cheapest bag of groceries, Willys 
has a unique position in the market  Its growth during the year was 
exceptional, and it is clear that customers appreciate the concept 
– not only existing ones, but also the many new customers that 
have been attracted in the last few years  Willys is Sweden’s most 
recommended food retail chain, with a strong brand and a high 
level of customer loyalty, in stores as well as in e-commerce  This 
is a fantastic base on which to build further 
In cross-border shopping with Norway, Eurocash continued 
to grow and, following investments in store modernisations and 
concept development in the last few years, it confirmed its posi­
tion as the leading food retail chain on the border 
Hemköp posted excellent growth during the year: not only 
higher than in the traditional grocery segment but also outper­
forming the market  Hemköp has a competitive offering with a 
strong focus on price value and inspiration as well as a high pace 
of store modernisation  Hemköp has also strengthened its position 
with regard to sustainability, and in the last few years the chain 
has had the highest share of sales of organic food in the industry  
On the other hand, Tempo had a challenging year in the same mar­
ket segment, and delivered a weak performance due to an increas­
ingly difficult market climate for smaller store formats 
Throughout the years, restaurant wholesaler Snabbgross has 
demonstrated an ability to perform regardless of the market 
climate  Despite a weaker market in 2023, investments in an 
affordable and flexible offering generated good growth and 
profitability for Snabbgross, and the concept captured additional 
market share  The member-based consumer concept Snabbgross 
Club also expanded through additional store conversions 
Our innovative development companies provide long-term 
growth potential and strengthen the total customer offering of 
the Axfood family  The online pharmacy Apohem continued to 
grow and gain market share during the year, and with its focus on 
health and inspiration, it is challenging traditional players in the 
market  The meal-kit company Middagsfrid continued to focus 
on its new concept during the year and demonstrated a strong 
development, while the focus for the Urban Deli restaurant chain 
was on navigating a challenging market and combining appealing 
food experiences with price value 
High rate of change and major strides towards the future
In parallel with managing shift in demand and changing customer 
behaviour, we are continuing our efforts to strengthen our long-
term competitiveness  A large part of this involves developing the 
customer offering and improving availability, assortment and the 
shopping experience  At the same time, it is important to further 
improve cost efficiency to deliver an assortment with competitive 
prices, not least in times of high price consciousness  
Axfood’s most comprehensive investment in the future in the 
last few years has been developing a new logistics structure for 
the Group  After several years of planning, building and installa­
tion, we were able to put our new highly automated logistics cen­
tre in Bålsta outside Stockholm into operation at the beginning of 
the year  This was a major milestone  The logistics centre in Bålsta 
represents an entirely new way of handling warehouse and logis­
tics operations, and has been ramped up gradually in the last year 
to be completed in 2024  Efforts to strengthen other parts of the 
logistics structure also proceeded according to plan during the 
year  Planning continues for the new high-bay warehouse in Backa 
in Gothenburg, while the automation solution at the new fruit and 
vegetable warehouse in Landskrona recently went into operation 
Digitalisation, AI and automation are advancing rapidly  These 
areas are essential for creating high levels of efficiency and strong 
customer offerings  In addition to logistics, our ongoing develop­
ment projects also include new tools for planning and optimising 
prices, campaigns and the assortment  We are also devoting 
significant focus to improving ways of working in our stores in 
order to simplify operations for our employees 
In other words, things are moving full steam ahead in all parts 
of Axfood  We are developing at a rapid pace to further strengthen 
the competitiveness of our own concepts as well as wholesale 
customers, and to offer an even more comprehensive and afford­
able assortment with a world-class product supply 
“
In a changing 
market, we look 
back at a strong year 
with a growth rate 
twice as high as that 
of the market

High tempo in sustainability
While we focus on delivering affordable, good and sustainable 
food here and now, and increasing efficiency in operations, we 
also work intensively to address our most long-term challenges  
We have an ambitious and wide-ranging sustainability agenda, 
and it is imperative that we continue to move it forward – even 
though changes in consumer purchasing behaviour in the last few 
years have not benefited sustainable or healthy consumption 
Continuing to develop our sustainable and healthy product 
assortment is a top priority for us, and we put a great deal of 
emphasis on guiding consumers to healthier, more sustainable 
choices in order to increase sales of sustainability-labelled 
products and to reduce our carbon footprint per kilo of food sold 
To reduce the climate impact of our own operations as well as 
in the food supply chain, we have initiated several major invest­
ments in solar panel facilities  In addition to building Sweden’s 
largest rooftop solar power facility on the new logistics centre in 
Bålsta and installing a large solar power facility on the fruit and 
vegetable warehouse in Landskrona, we are building Sweden’s 
largest onshore solar park in Hallstavik  We also contribute to the 
green transition by increasing the share of fossil-free transports, 
and recently decided to transition to using renewable fuels in our 
own as well as procured trucks for transports from warehouses to 
stores in the next two years  I also want to mention our work to 
support biodiversity, minimise food waste and promote diversity, 
equality and inclusion  These areas are also key for our operations

A changing environment
Digitalisation, sustainability, health and price 
value are examples of long-term trends that 
are having a major impact on society, the food 
retail industry and Axfood  The change of pace

the last two years the high rate of inflation has 
entailed certain shifts in trends, primarily an 
increased price consciousness among consumers 
How changes are taking place –The population is becoming both younger and older –Income gaps in society are increasing –More diversity and a higher number of people born abroad –Continued rapid pace of urbanisation, affecting both 
cities and the countryside
Impact on the food retail market –As a result of demographic changes, demand is changing 
when it comes to assortment and price point –Urbanisation is creating new attractive store locations 
and scope for online shopping while certain locations 
are becoming less attractive
How Axfood operates –Continual assortment development to offer affordable, 
good and sustainable food as well as meeting demand for 
an assortment that reflects a variety of cuisines –Establishment of stores and online shopping in growth 
locations and locations with convenient transportation links –Clear values and an ambition to reflect the diversity found in 
society in order to meet various needs
Demographics
How changes are taking place –Traditional food retail companies invest more based on 
price considerations –The market’s players are creating ecosystems of products 
and services –Innovative companies are challenging and seeking

of economic uncertainty and high inflation –Digitalisation is leading to increased price transparency –A low price is not the only factor determining whether a 
product offers value for money – pleasant service, attractive 
peripheral services and a high-quality assortment are also 
important
Impact on the food retail market –Increased price consciousness is having a positive impact 
on certain market segments, particularly discount players –Price comparisons require market players to continually mon­
itor their price positions –Consumers are focusing more on price value and demanding 
an assortment that offers alternatives to strong global and 
national brands –Private label products and large purchasing volumes are key 
for being able to offer price value
How Axfood operates –A focus on strengthening Willys’ position as Sweden’s leading 
discount grocery chain and ensuring that all concepts in the

people  There are a total of just over 3,000 food retail stores 
around Sweden  The sector is important for young people, who 
account for nearly a third of the total number of those employed  
In the countryside, grocery stores often serve as a community hub, 
offering pharmacy services, postal services and package pick-up 
The food retail market is relatively unaffected by economic 
swings and growth is driven largely by population growth and 
inflation  Annual market growth has historically been between 
2% and 3%  The market is mature, and the three largest players 
– ICA, Axfood and Coop – together account for approximately 
90% of sales  During 2023, Axfood’s market share is estimated 
to have been about 22% (21) 
Market share development, %
For some time now, growth in food retail has been strongest in the 
discount segment, where Willys is the leading player  The segment 
represents just over a fifth of the market and can be divided into 
two sub-segments, hard discount and soft discount  The biggest 
difference between the two consists of the offering and breadth of 
assortment  During the last five years up to 2022, average annual 
growth for the discount segment is estimated at around 9%, 
­
compared with just over 4% for the market as a whole 
Strong trends from the last few year years include an increased 
share of online shopping within in food retail  This trend acceler­
ated significantly during the pandemic between 2020 and 2021, 
but the subsequent return to shopping in physical stores is clear  
E-commerce still accounts for a small share of the market, around 
4 1% in 2023 1) Sales within e-commerce are relatively evenly 
­
distributed between store pick-up and home delivery

Swedish foodservice
The players in the foodservice market provide groceries, bever­
ages and kitchen supplies, and sell to restaurants, cafés, fast-food 
operators, B2B customers and the public sector  A large share of 
sales in the market go through distribution from wholesalers to 
customers, and only a few players offer shopping through physical 
stores  Direct distribution from producers accounts for a small 
share of sales 
The foodservice market is relatively consolidated and is made 
up of a number of large players and numerous smaller specialists  
Snabbgross focuses mainly on the private market, where the four 
largest players – Martin & Servera, Snabbgross, Menigo and 
Svensk Cater – together account for somewhat more than 85% 
of sales 1)
Development during the year
Sales in the private foodservice market increased by 11% in 2023 
and amounted to just over SEK 31 bn (28) 1) Growth was entirely 
driven by high food price inflation  A slight slowdown in growth 
was noted during the second half of the year as consumer pur­
chasing power decreased  The segments on the consumer market 
for cafés and restaurants that displayed the largest increases 
during the year were hotel restaurants, fast food operators and 
roadside restaurants 2)

Financial targets
Ambitious targets and clear direction
Axfood manages and continuously monitors the Group’s operations based on a set of strategic 
Group-wide targets  By maintaining a strong financial position and sustainable operations, 
scope and conditions are created for long-term profitable growth 
Growth
Profitability
Financial position
Axfood will grow faster than the market  
In 2023, Axfood’s retail sales increased by 14 3% 
(11 9), while market growth was 7 5% (5 7)1) 
The equity ratio is to amount to at least 20% 
at year-end  As of 31 December 2023, the equity 
ratio was 23 9% (24 1) 
The operating margin will be at least 4 5% over 
the long term  The operating margin in 2023 was 
4 1% (4 2) 
Comments
With different concepts and strong market 
positions, Axfood has grown faster than the 
market for several years, both in physical stores 
and in e-commerce  The trend has accelerated 
during the last two years, in particularly for 
Willys, and Axfood has grown twice as much 
as the market 
Comments
Axfood has a solid balance sheet, and the 
business model generates stable cash flow  
The aim is to maintain a strong financial 
position to have the scope and flexibility 
to make investments that will lead to long-
term benefits for the Group 
Comments
Due to investments in logistics and the acquisi­
tion of Bergendahls Food, the operating margin 
was under the profitability target for the last 
two years  However, these investments, 
together with the development in the store 
chains, are expected to create favourable con­
ditions for increased profitability over time

Comments
Axfood will offer its employees a healthy work 
environment with good working conditions that 
contribute to a low rate of sickness-related 
absence  During the year, sickness-related 
absence decreased from a relatively high level 
owing to effects from the pandemic

Carbon footprint, own operations
Carbon footprint, food sold
Axfood will have net zero emissions from its own 
operations by 2030 at the latest  In 2023, total 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 
part of Scope 3) amounted to 46,475 tonnes of 
CO2 equivalents (44,571) 
Axfood is to promote more sustainable con­
sumption and production of food by annually 
reducing its carbon footprint per kilo of food 
sold  In 2023, the carbon footprint per kilo of 
food sold was 1 9 kilo CO2 equivalents (1 9) 
Comments
The climate target helps to limit GHG emissions 
to meet both national environmental goals and 
the Paris Agreement  In 2023, however, emis­
sions increased primarily as a result of higher 
emissions from procured transports  To counter­
act this negative trend going forward, work has 
been initiated to accelerate the phase-out of 
fossil fuel by switching to using renewable fuel 
in both own and procured transports from 
­
warehouses to stores 
Comments
Axfood shall reduce the assortment’s carbon 
footprint by offering products that contribute to 
more sustainable protein consumption, such as 
a wide selection of sustainable plant-based 
products  To achieve this transition, new prod­
ucts are continually being developed that taste 
good and are affordable and sustainably pro­
duced  There are no comparison figures for this 
key performance indicator before 2022 due to a 
lack of data

Comments
Sustainability-labelled goods guides consumers to 
products that are made in a way that takes envi­
ronmental and social aspects into account  These 
products are often higher in price since they are 
generally more expensive to produce, and in the 
last two years, their share of sales has declined, 
partly due to consumers’ increased price con­
sciousness due to high inflation  The development 
of both the customer offering and customer meet­
ing with regards to sustainability and health is a 
high priority within the Group

CUSTOMER OFFERING
It is clear that consumers are increasingly looking for price value, 
inspiration and convenient meal solutions  At the same time, 
awareness is growing, which is leading to higher standards for 
quality and sustainability  Consumers also attach importance to 
country of origin labelling, good animal welfare and reduced use ­
of chemicals  Based on this, Axfood continuously develops the 
customer offering in close cooperation with the Group’s suppliers  
The range consists of more than 70,000 items, and just over 32% 
of the Group’s sales consist of private label products 
At Axfood, major emphasis is placed on cultivating good rela­
tionships with suppliers of branded and private label products, ­
and thousands of supplier negotiations are carried out each year  
Suppliers rate Axfood highly as an appreciated partner, and in 
order to recognise and inspire trusting partnerships, Axfood 
organises an annual supplier meet-and-greet where a prize for 
supplier of the year is awarded 
Clear focus on price value 
Axfood’s assortment and category work revolves around the 
­
various concepts and their respective customer groups  Within the 
respective concepts’ market positions, the customer offering is 
built on an efficient and attractive assortment with a distinct price 
point  Growth and customer satisfaction are achieved by allowing 
strong global and national brands to be displayed side by side with 
private label products on store shelves  Collaboration with the two 
purchasing organisations European Marketing Distribution (EMD) 
and United Nordic contributes to economies of scale and ensures 
a wide and relevant offering 
Price value has become increasingly important for customers, 
and in 2023 high food price inflation also led to an increase in 
demand for discount and campaign goods  Price value is therefore 
An affordable, good and sustainable 
assortment for everyone
Axfood offers a wide assortment of products that meet customers’ diverse needs 
and preferences  A distinctive and relevant offering of branded as well as private 
label products enables affordable, good and sustainable food for everyone  
highly prioritised at Axfood and characterised the Group’s work 
with the assortment during the year 
The integration of Axfood’s customer offering into City Gross’ 
stores continued during the year, and City Gross now follows the 
same processes and ways of working as other Axfood chains  
In line with the City Gross strategy, additional steps were taken 
within assortment development and additional private label 
products from Axfood’s brand portfolio were launched 
Leading innovations and meal solutions
Axfood collaborates with local companies, entrepreneurs and 
re­
searchers to develop the food of the future  The offering of meal 
solutions is also continuously evolving to meet steadily rising con­
sumer demand  Meal solutions are developed under private labels 
at the same time as the offering of warm food in stores is growing 
During the year, the offering of ready meals in stores was 
expanded, through branded as well as private label products, 
such as soups and pasta  Demand is also increasing for salad 
bars, and Hemköp’s buffet of hot dishes was rolled out in some 
30 stores  Many Hemköp stores also offer sandwiches, salads 
and single-serving meals  Prepared foods in heated cabinets 
were expanded both at Willys and Hemköp, adding fast food like 
pizza and burek 
As part of expanding the assortment with more sustainable and 
healthy alternatives, Axfood carried out a large-scale launch of a 
mince with equal amounts of mince beef and vegetables under the 
Garant brand in 2023  The Nöt & Grönt mince is Keyhole-labelled, 
bears the “Kött från Sverige” (Meat from Sweden) label and is 
attractively priced  The launch was part of a partnership with 
­
Generation Pep, an organisation that works to support the health 
of young people (read more in the box to the right) 
Priorities 2024 – Develop and strengthen the assortment of affordable, good 
and sustainable food – Develop and strengthen the private label product assortment – Strengthen the price position – Develop the meal solutions offering
Axfood will offer an attractive 
assortment that is relevant, 
sustainable and affordable 
Transparency across the entire value chain
To maintain credibility among today’s conscious consumers, food 
retailers need to exercise greater transparency surrounding the 
assortment’s entire value chain  Axfood’s thousands of suppliers 
around the world are required to comply with its Code of Conduct 
in the areas of human rights, working conditions, the environment 
and anti-corruption 
Read more about the Group’s sustainability work in the supply 
chain on pages 92–96 
Axfood’s goal is to create a healthier Sweden by 2030  
Axfood aims to contribute to better public health and 
good food habits for everyone by increasing knowledge 
and facilitating healthy choices  As part of the long-term 
partnership between Axfood and Generation Pep that 
began at the end of 2022, the organisations work to spread 
information about making healthier choices, and facilitate 
and conduct activities that encourage children and young 
people in this area so they can live a more wholesome,

Share of private label products 
of retail sales
Axfood’s extensive array of private label products, including 
Garant, Eldorado, Minstingen, Fixa, Såklart, Mevolution and 
Gastrino, gives a significant competitive edge  The products 
contribute to profitable growth by creating an attractive and 
distinctive assortment that strengthens the offerings within 
Axfood’s various concepts  Products are subject to strict 
requirements and are discerningly tested, and an external 
consumer panel samples a large share of products before 
they advance to production  The Group’s assortment devel­
opers are innovation-driven and identify niches in the market, 
using customer data to develop products that are at the fore­
front of current food trends, health and sustainability 
Of Axfood’s private labels, Garant and Eldorado are the 
most strongly positioned with respect to quality and price  
Garant is a well-known brand with a distinct added-value 
profile, and surveys demonstrate that knowledge of and 
loyalty to Garant are very high  Eldorado aims to be the best 
discount alternative with a focus on basic products  ­
Surveys 
show a positive trend in terms of approval and the desire to 
repurchase Eldorado products in the past few years  
All private label products are quality assured and meet 
stringent sustainability requirements  The difference 
between, for example, Garant and Eldorado is that Eldorado 
allows for sourcing from a broader origin and is more varied 
in terms of design and appearance 
About 140 new private label products were launched 
during the year  The rate of development remains high, even 
if challenging circumstances related to the price trend and

Priorities 2024 – Develop and optimise the store base – Develop the digital customer meeting – Develop customer meeting with respect to price value, 
sustainability and health – Explore future payment solutions and financial services
With relevant concepts and 
high accessibility, Axfood is 
meeting customers’ various 
and changing needs 
CUSTOMER MEETING
Everyone has different needs and preferences  Demographics, 
budgets, daily routines and family situations are just a few of the 
many factors that influence how consumers prefer to do their 
­
grocery shopping  It is therefore important to offer a variety of 
concepts and channels that allow consumers’ own preferences 
to steer their food purchases 
Modern and accessible stores 
Axfood’s stores must be accessible to customers so that it is con­
venient and easy to shop  With the help of a broad contact net­
work in the real estate sector and own forecasts, the Group can 
identify geographic areas where its store concepts can add value  
Just as important as the stores being at the right locations are 
personal customer meetings, where the employees are the front-
line ambassadors 
The work on upgrading existing stores is continuously ongoing 
to ensure customers are given the best possible in-store experi­
ence  In addition to continuous improvements to create inspiring 
environments, stores are modernised every five to seven years 
New ways are continually being introduced for using digital 
tools to improve customers’ in-store experience  During the year, 
Willys continued to roll out scanning and mobile payment solutions 
to more stores 
Broad e-commerce offering
Axfood has a strong digital presence with a mix of omnichannel 
players and pure-play e-commerce retailers  It is important that 
customers feel at home and find the same prices online as in 
stores  The various food concepts therefore reflect the same 
­
market positions online as in the physical stores  
The customer in focus
It should be easy and convenient for customers to shop for affordable, good 
and sustainable food  With a high degree of accessibility, Axfood is there for 
everyone – seamlessly and regardless of sales channel 
In e-commerce, customers’ varying preferences for order delivery 
are met  The store chains offer flexible delivery alternatives, and 
a central part of meeting customers’ needs is being able to offer 
home delivery as well as store pick-up 
Popular customer programmes
The majority of sales are made through the various concepts’ loy­
alty programmes, and personal offers based on previous purchas­
ing preferences are directed to customers digitally 
Willys Plus is a popular customer loyalty programme with close 
to 3 6 million members  Data is used to create better offerings, and 
all campaign materials are uniquely tailored to the individual 
customer to ensure the most relevant content possible 
Hemköp’s Klubb Hemköp loyalty programme has increased 
customer loyalty through personalisation and relevance  Klubb 
Hemköp inspires and guides its just over 2 0 million members to 
take positive action  In addition to bonus points awarded for all 
purchases, extra points are awarded for sustainable and healthy 
choices, such as buying organic products or fruit and vegetables, 
or selecting digital receipts 
The Snabbgross B2B customer programme is being continually 
developed and more than 100,000 customers are reached with 
targeted and relevant offerings  In Snabbgross’ store concept 
Snabbgross Club, members can access campaigns, targeted offer­
ings and inspiration to shop the unique brands and bulk packages 
that the concept offers and that are not available in traditional 
food retail  The number of registered members in Snabbgross Club 
has grown to approximately 75,000 
Digital development
To meet evolving customer needs, Axfood is working on its core 
business as well as on development and innovation in new areas 
A large focus area for Willys and Hemköp in 2023 was to 
develop the digital customer meeting to make it more inspiring, 
relevant and easier to shop online  Customers can now log in using 
BankID and see personal recipe recommendations  It is also easier 
to find products and be inspired to try new products  Hemköp also 
launched a new app to strengthen the customer meeting and 
increase loyalty 
A hybrid solution where staffed opening hours are supple­
mented with unstaffed opening hours launched in a number 
of Tempo stores during the year  By downloading an app and 
registering with BankID, customers can visit and shop at an 
unstaffed Tempo store  This is in line with Tempo’s ambition 
to made good food and service readily available, and gives cus­
tomers better accessibility through generous opening hours

room for additional stores  The ability to operate across the entire 
country with a locally adapted assortment and different owner­
ship forms is a strength of Hemköp and Tempo  Axfood’s brand 
portfolio also includes the Handlar’n and Matöppet concepts, 
which perform well in smaller local markets 
A competitive e-commerce
Axfood’s store network offers customers a high degree of accessi­
bility, even for pick-up of online orders  When it comes to store 
pick-up, for Axfood it has proven to be the most popular delivery 
option, allowing customers to pick up their groceries when it suits 
them best  At the end of the year, 158 Willys stores and 67 Hemköp 
stores offered online shopping 
All Snabbgross stores offer e-commerce to B2B customers  
Middagsfrid offers pre-planned meal kits complete with recipes in 
urban locations  Mathem, in which Axfood is a minority owner, is a 
pure-play online grocery retailer with home delivery  Apohem is a 
full-scale online retail pharmacy that offers home delivery of phar­
macy products throughout Sweden 
Conversions of Hemköp and Tempo stores 
The number of Hemköp retailer-owned stores can vary somewhat 
from year to year depending on agreements and continuous eval­
uation of which form would enable a particular store to best 
strengthen Hemköp’s position in the market  Hemköp has a financ­
ing programme known as 91/9 that enables selected store manag­
ers to acquire a store 
EXPANSION
Axfood has a broad, nationwide presence, with a particularly 
strong performance and growth in major cities  With a diversified 
portfolio of food retail concepts, the Group also has a presence in 
smaller cities, primarily through retailer-owned stores 
New establishments in attractive locations
Geographic location, flows and the infrastructure surrounding 
a physical store are of major importance for reaching customers  
The ability to identify locations that are accessible and easy to 
reach for consumers is crucial for a successful establishment  
Each potential new establishment is evaluated based on data-
driven analysis, where movement patterns, demographics and 
purchasing power are included in the assessment of the right 
­
concept for the location 
Axfood has a presence in most of Sweden, but there remains 
good potential for expansion of new physical stores  For example, 
the Group has historically had a somewhat smaller presence in 
the northern parts of Sweden, but as major investments are being 
made in industry and infrastructure in these parts of the country, 
there is significant growth potential that is followed closely 
During the year, 12 new Group-owned stores and 4 retailer-­
owned stores were established  At the end of the year, Axfood had 
a total of 337 Group-owned stores and 266 retailer-owned stores 
A favourable business model
Axfood’s strategy with different concepts working together is 
favourable when it comes to establishment opportunities  Para­
meters such as size of premises, customer base and whether the 
store is Group- or retailer-owned are taken into consideration to 
assess which brand is appropriate for each individual establish­
ment  Another advantage is that, when necessary, stores can be 
converted to another concept if conditions change 
A growing Group
Axfood’s target is to grow faster than the market  This will be achieved through 
continued establishment of new stores, a broad e-commerce offering and the 
development of new customer offerings 
Axfood will grow in new and 
existing areas by establishing 
stores and e-commerce as well 
as developing new offerings 
Priorities 2024 – Expand store network and e-commerce – Strengthen positions of the development companies 
Axfood has a broad 
presence, with a 
particularly strong 
performance and 
growth in major cities

SUPPLY CHAIN
Dagab is Axfood’s purchasing and logistics company and is 
responsible for the Group’s product flow  Goods are distributed to 
the Group-owned stores and external customers, such as retail­
er-owned stores and convenience retailers  Separate e-commerce 
warehouses handle home deliveries for the e-commerce business 
in Stockholm and Gothenburg 
Dagab’s delivery fleet is made up of 200 heavy-duty trucks  The 
filling ratio is optimised for efficiency and environmental purposes, 
and trucks deliver goods from the Group’s warehouses to stores 
across the entire country  Approximately half of all volumes are 
handled by the Group’s own fleet, which has a number of advan­
tages, including that Axfood can use its own transport knowledge 
and experience to set high demands on procured transports  At the 
same time, external transports provide flexibility and contribute to 
efficiency and sustainability, particularly in the countryside where 
transports are largely coordinated with other providers in order to 
optimise the filling ratio  In addition to its heavy-duty trucks, 
Dagab has 86 light trucks and vans for e-commerce deliveries  
High demands are placed on safe work and traffic environments 
and on reducing the carbon footprint by promoting eco-driving 
and transitioning to sustainable fuels 
During the last few years, a new, modernised transport manage­
ment system was implemented, which enables route optimisation, 
gives a broader overview of transport flows and manages flows to 
both stores and e-commerce customers  The system also offers 
consumers improved order tracking 
Continued steps toward 
an optimised logistics platform
Changed consumption patterns, digitalisation and the importance of ensuring competitiveness are 
driving the development of more sustainable and efficient product supply  Axfood’s own warehouses 
and well-developed fleet of delivery vehicles supply products to stores and e-commerce customers 
throughout Sweden  To further strengthen the base operations, extensive investments are being made 
into the logistics platform 
Investments in logistics of the future
Investments to create a more sustainable, efficient and competi­
tive product supply continued in 2023  These major investments 
will ensure a world-class nationwide logistics platform that will 
strengthen the entire Axfood family and external customers  The 
new, highly automated logistics centre in Bålsta is one of the larg­
est of its kind in Europe and the facilities are comprehensive  The 
facility is planned to be fully operational in 2024 and will handle 
the distribution of groceries to stores as well as to e-commerce 
customers  The investment is unique in that it will gather the entire 
flow and processes for stores and e-commerce under one and the 
same roof  The logistics centre will handle all temperature zones 
and contribute to further optimisation of the product flow through 
a faster and more flexible supply chain  Underlying processes will 
also be made more efficient, which will help reduce food waste  
The logistics centre will handle about 60% of Dagab’s volumes, 
and space is being built to further increase capacity by at least 
40% compared with 2019  The ramp-up is proceeding in phases, 
and in 2023 automation for the handling of goods in the dry and 
frozen assortments was taken into operations, with gradually 
increasing volumes  In 2024, the ramp-up continues for goods in the 
frozen assortment, and deliveries for e-commerce will begin  To develop and streamline operations and accommodate future 
volume growth, Axfood inaugurated a new, larger nationwide 
warehouse for fruit and vegetables in Landskrona in 2022  The 
warehouse is being semi-automated, and the solution will be fully 
operational in 2024 
To add additional pallet space and meet future volume growth, 
the existing high-bay warehouse at the Backa distribution centre 
in Gothenburg is being strengthened and expanded to include two 
new automated aisles  This will increase the total capacity by 
approximately 30%  In 2023, groundwork began for the new 
construction 
Green transition of delivery fleet
Emissions from transports account for a large share of the Group’s 
total carbon footprint  After extensive investments in various 
types of vehicles, all Group-owned trucks can now be driven on 
fossil-free fuels   To reduce emissions, work has been initiated to 
accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel by switching to using 
renewable fuel in both own and procured transports from ware­
houses to stores 
For several years, Dagab and Scania have had a close collabo­
ration concerning fossil-free transportation  Using advanced 
­
analytics, it is investigated how fast it is possible to transition  
Dagab has prepared an electrification plan and continues the 
journey towards a reduced carbon footprint  Today, Dagab has 
three fully electric heavy-duty trucks that make local and regional 
shipments in Stockholm and Gothenburg  Dagab put Scania’s first 
fully electric 64-tonne truck and trailer into service and was the 
first company in Sweden to operate Scania’s first fully electric 
heavy-duty truck in 2021  Dagab also has Volvo’s first mass­
-
produced heavy-duty electric truck in its vehicle fleet 
Priorities 2024 – Develop future warehouse structure – Streamline operations with new warehouse structure – Streamline and develop sustainable transport 
solutions of the future
Axfood will develop a
sustainable product supply 
with high efficiency and quality

WORK APPROACH
Automation and digitalisation
Food retail is undergoing a shift, with digitalisation and automation high on the agenda  
Axfood can become even more competitive and relevant for customers by working both 
faster and more strategically with data 
Axfood’s IT company has approximately 300 employees who 
create value and efficiency for all of Axfood’s operations through 
innovation, digital development and automation  This enables the 
Group to be at the forefront in areas such as the digital customer 
meeting, e-commerce and work approach 
To adopt a more agile work approach with quality and high 
value to the business, cooperation and development takes place 
cross-functionally between companies, departments and experts 
in product area teams  The work of engaged employees creates 
an ability to change, flexibility, and more satisfied customers and 
users  In projects, steering committees represent the entire Group 
to ensure an overall perspective 
Data-driven organisation
A data-driven work approach is continually being developed and 
permeates the entire organisation  With the help of data and ana­
lytics, communication is becoming personalised and customers 
can be offered more relevant products and offers 
Axfood has developed internal competence in advanced analyt­
ics of customer data in its category and purchasing work  Data 
analytics is allowing better management of the assortment and 
prices while making customer offers more personalised  To 
improve processes and create a more efficient and attractive 
offering, the Group’s IT platforms were updated in recent years  
The project was conducted to improve the campaign and assort­
ment process and entails a higher degree of automation and bet­
ter decision-making documentation with data and analyses 
During the coming year, work with integrating AI into the 
Group’s processes and ways of working will be accelerated  
A particular focus will be on opportunities with generative AI 
Efficiency with a digital work approach
The Group’s technical platforms are being developed on a continu­
ous basis, and in stores and warehouses, the level of automation 
and digitalisation is increasing  Inventory levels, product flows and 
routes are optimised using data and AI  Automated orders enable 
the correct amount of items to be ordered at the right time  Hand-
held computers are used in stores to efficiently identify goods 
nearing their best-before dates, providing better control over the 
assortment and contributing to reducing food waste  Finger scan­
ners can be used in store to quickly and easily scan products when 
e-commerce orders are assembled  A new modern, fast, and flexi­
ble cash register system has in recent years been implemented in 
Axfood’s stores, corresponding to more than 4,000 new cash reg­
isters and payment terminals 
All employees have their own digital identity, which creates 
favourable conditions for internal communication, targeted infor­
mation and training based on the user’s company affiliation, work­
place and role  Through digital training courses, guides and engag­
ing content, employees are urged to continuously develop their 
digital literacy 
With the help of robots, time-consuming administrative duties 
can be automated  Robots take care of tasks such as quality con­
trol, final approval of flows and filtering of documents  Robotic 
process automation (RPA) is giving rise to a host of benefits  Pro­
cesses are being streamlined and standardised at the same time 
as employees are being relieved of time-consuming tasks 
Information security high on the agenda
Digitalisation is creating opportunities and new ways of working, 
but also increases the need to protect information and ensure 
­
stable IT operations  Information security is therefore a prioritised 
area in the Group  Major emphasis is being placed on preventive 
efforts and organisation in order to detect and manage threats 
and disruptions and ensure operational continuity in the event of 
unforeseen events  Continual efforts are also being made to raise 
internal awareness of information security issues, including 
measures such as a shared strategy, training and new technical 
solutions 
Priorities 2024 – Accelerate advanced analysis, AI and digital ways of working – Develop and implement new store platform – Strenghten work with cyber security – Active work with social impact to promote increased 
sustainability, health and competitiveness
Axfood is to be a customer­
-
oriented, dynamic and 
­
sustainable organisation 
with a focus on efficiency 
and development

approach is continually 
being developed and

Axfood has more than 13,000 employees (FTEs) and promotes a 
culture in which employees are actively committed  In the past few 
years, Axfood’s reputation as a stable and secure employer that 
makes a difference has been further strengthened – making it 
attractive to those who have already begun their careers and to 
the employees of the future 
Reflection of customers
Axfood endeavours to reflect the diversity found among its cus­
tomers, and offers all employees fair opportunities to contribute 
and grow professionally  Axfood aims to be an inclusive employer 
where everyone is treated with respect based on their unique cir­
cumstances  Inclusion is deeply rooted in the Group’s culture  
Axfood has clear objectives to have a diversity of representa­
tion at all senior levels  A diversity of perspectives and ways of 
solving problems provides innovative strength and increases 
knowledge  This makes the Group even better at meeting custom­
ers’ varying needs  It is also a reflection of what job candidates in 
the labour market are looking for today – meaningful work with 
values that match their own 
Axfood works with objective and fair processes for finding new 
employees, where competence rather than age, gender and back­
ground is what is important  Succession planning is part of these 
efforts to fill the pipeline of management candidates and achieve 
the Group’s diversity and gender equality targets  Axfood’s goal is 
that the breakdown of men and women in management positions 
will be in the range of 40–60%, a target that was once again 
reached in 2023  
During the year, Axfood registered 165,740 applications for the 
2,444 positions in total posted within the Group  This represents 
an average of 68 applicants per position  Employees as enablers
Axfood views diversity, equality and inclusion as self-evident and crucial aspects of its business  
Axfood’s employees meet millions of customers each week, and the organisation is therefore 
continually being ­
developed to benefit from employees’ different expertise, perspectives 
and potential while meeting customer needs 
Many development opportunities
Being part of Axfood offers many development opportunities and 
the Group has the ambition that everyone can grow, regardless of 
their position  Senior managers and new employees can develop 
when the right conditions are in place  Employees are encouraged 
to develop personally and to try different positions and roles 
within the Group 
Axfood Academy, with both internal and external instructors, 
is the Group’s centre for continuing education and skills develop­
ment  Courses focus on various roles in stores, warehouses and 
offices  Axfood Academy works with the ambition to move learn­
ing out into the operations, which research shows has the greatest 
effect  Many courses are considered to be part of an “educational 
journey” where learning is spread out over time, with a number of 
components explored as part of the employees’ day-to-day work  
Axfood is a growing Group and therefore has a continuous need 
for new leaders  Through various activities, such as instructor-led 
training, e-learning, manager coaching and various exercises per­
formed in stores, employees are prepared to take the next step in 
their careers in Axfood  Specific leadership steps have been devel­
oped to provide store employees with the opportunity to become 
team managers or store managers  Just over 80% of Axfood’s 
managers are appointed internally 
All employees at the Group’s support offices are encouraged 
to do an in-store work placement for one day during the year  
These in-store work placements are a good way of increasing the 
employee’s understanding of the core operations and of how their 
own efforts impacts this work 
EMPLOYEES
A sustainable workplace
Axfood’s efforts to promote a sustainable work life include long-
term strategic investments  Investments to support increased 
health and reduce sickness-related absence are supported by 
Group-wide initiatives, clear procedures and ways of working, and 
quality-assured processes and tools  An annual follow-up is carried 
out in the form of an internal work environment audit, which forms 
the basis for any measures taken  Employees are Axfood’s most 
important resource  That is why it is self-evident that work environ­
ments should be positive and that employees should feel safe and 
can act without risk to their health, or the health of others  A sys­
tem for reporting accidents and safety incidents is used within the 
Group to evaluate, remedy and follow up on risks, incidents and 
accidents  The system helps to identify risks and remedy them for 
preventive purposes  System support is also available for manag­
ers to address sickness-related absence and rehabilitation  For 
example, managers are notified of recurring short-term absences 
due to sickness and are guided through the entire rehabilitation 
process for long-term absences due to sickness  
Mental health is a major societal concern  That is why Axfood 
launched a service that allows employees to speak anonymously 
with a social worker, psychologist, lawyer or economist  Managers 
can use the service to receive leadership guidance and assistance 
Axfood aspires to be the 
­
market’s most attractive 
employer and to engage and 
help its employees to develop 
the right skills and work

Risk management process
To prevent risks or mitigate their effects and loss, Axfood works 
with an established enterprise risk management process, where 
risks are continuously identified, managed and reported  In this 
work, all risks are assessed based on probability and consequence  
Operational and strategic risks include sustainability risks 
Risks are assessed and documented by the respective risk 
­
owners at least twice a year as well as on a continuing basis where 
necessary  An assessment is made of the changed level of existing 
risks as well as of potential new risks  Strategic risks, such as 
increased competition, changes in the assortment and other 
changes in the external business environment that can affect 
Axfood’s strategic objectives, are managed as part of the continu­
ing work of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee 
Risks are classified and categorised according to how well 
countermeasures are implemented  The risk owners are the mem­
bers of the Executive Committee, who are responsible for the risk 
maps in their respective areas  Axfood has a Risk Committee, which 
is headed by the Group’s Risk Manager  The Risk Committee is 
tasked with, among other things, following up on planned counter­
measures and consolidating the risks identified by the respective 
risk owners  A compilation is made centrally and coincides with the 
timing of the Group’s business plan, which facilitates budgeting for 
decided countermeasures  For a description of the organisation, 
governance and reporting of Axfood’s risk management, see the 
illustration to the right 
Like all business activities, Axfood’s business is exposed to risks  Risks are something that can affect the 
operations negatively  Managed properly, however, they can also add value  How risks are managed is of 
great significance  Axfood breaks down risks into operational, strategic and financial risks

Strategic and operational risks
(A) Acquisition risks
Axfood acquires and establishes new operations on a regular 
basis  If the conditions in the operations do not correspond to 
what was known prior to such decisions, for example, prior to an 
acquisition having been carried out, there is a risk that this could 
have a negative impact on Axfood’s earnings and brand  With 
respect to acquisitions, a well-executed integration and retaining 
key persons are also important  All new store establishments 
and acquisitions are preceded by thorough market analyses of 
the competition as well as demographics, where every investment 
calculation stretches over several years  In addition, the external 
operating environment as well as the business’ profile are anal­
ysed from ethical, social and environmental aspects, among 
other things

particularly regarding its private label products, but also for other 
products in its assortment  Mapping of risks at the supplier level is 
based on a number of different dimensions such as work environ­
ment, water supply, child labour, union rights, food and product 
safety, and animal welfare  Human rights challenges may arise 
in certain supplier countries  Quality assurance is conducted at 
several levels before a supplier is approved, and the selection cri­
teria include suppliers’ sustainability work  Purchasing is steered 
toward suppliers with developed sustainability work or a positive 
willingness to change  Axfood also makes recurring visits and or 
conducts audits at suppliers to discuss product knowledge, 
product development, compliance with the Code of Conduct 
and, where applicable, to investigate and follow up any defects  
A bankruptcy or serious fire at a critical supplier could result in 
disruptions in product flows  Therefore, alternative solutions are 
reviewed on a regular basis at the same time as high demands are 
placed on fire safety and the financial stability of critical counter­
parties  To maintain and preferably strengthen customers’ trust, 
it is also important to maintain good control of the supply chain  
(C) Market risks
Axfood operates in a competitive and dynamic market that 
requires a flexible and agile organisation to meet new customer 
needs and behaviours  To stay up to date with competitors and 
new trends, the market is constantly monitored  For example, 
customer and consumer surveys are conducted regularly, which 
together with other analyses form the basis of the Company’s 
strategies 
(D) Employee risks
The food retail industry is undergoing a rapid pace of change and 
digitalisation  Change management, skills development and 
attracting sought-after competencies are growing increasingly 
important  One currently pertinent and major change facing 
Axfood is that some of the Group’s existing warehouses will be 
replaced in 2024 by a new logistics centre in Bålsta, outside Stock­
holm  Recruiting, developing and retaining competent and com­
mitted employees is highly important for Axfood and necessary for 
the Group’s expansion and performance  To counter the negative 
effects of losses of key persons, the Company works continuously 
with succession planning  Axfood also devotes a great deal of 
focus to diversity and inclusion throughout the Group  All work­
places are to be free from all forms of discrimination and offensive 
treatment, which is clearly specified in the Group’s equal treat­
ment policy  Axfood is to be an attractive and sustainable work­
place where the focus on a constructive, healthy and inclusive 
work environment is fundamental 
(E) Regulatory risks
For Axfood, compliance with laws and other rules and regulations 
is fundamental, as is conducting business in accordance with 
­
generally accepted business practice  Violations or negligence 
in these areas could harm the Group’s reputation and result in 
sanctions as well as fines  For risk prevention purposes, a number 
of policies, a well-working system of internal control and an ethical 
approach to counter the soliciting or accepting of bribes and cor­
ruption have been established in all areas of the Group  Every sup­
plier the Company enters into an agreement with is required to 
adhere to the Group’s Code of Conduct or to have its own corre­
sponding requirements  The Code of Conduct is an integrated part 
of the purchasing process and is included in all supplier agree­
ments, except for certain local suppliers, which are handled 
directly at the local level  In connection with new laws or regula­
tions, measures are decided on well in advance of enactment  
(F) IT and information security risks
Digitalisation presents major opportunities but at the same time 
places greater demands on the ability to protect information and 
customer data as well as ensuring stable IT operations  In the past 
few years, a continued increase in cybercriminal activity has been 
observed  Information security is therefore a prioritised area and a 
natural part of the strategic agenda  Systematic efforts are ongo­
ing at Axfood based on a management system for information 
security, and the level of protection is continually monitored based 
on the current threat scenario  Major emphasis is placed on pre­
ventive work and the organisation in order to detect, handle and 
protect the Group’s operations from threats and disruptions as 
well as on ensuring operational continuity in the event of unfore­
seen events  Axfood has an updated IT security architecture 
based on Zero Trust and a roadmap of activities that are being 
implemented according to plan  This also involves continuously 
working on raising awareness of the risk of operational disruptions 
or losing sensitive data 
(G) Risk of disruptions in the logistics chain
One of the most serious business risks that the Group must man­
age is the risk of disruptions in the logistics chain, especially the 
risk of fire in its distribution centres, which would result in property 
loss and business interruption losses  Axfood devotes a great deal 
of focus to its systematic fire safety work and places emphasis on 
maintaining a well-working fire safety organisation with preven­
tive measures such as adequate training and pertinent proce­
dures, adapted technical fire safety measures, and recurring 
inspections and follow-up  Continuity planning is sustained and 
active  Another aspect that could affect the logistics chain is 
Axfood’s IT structure; see more information under Risk (F), IT and 
information security  
(H) Criminality
The trend of increased criminality in society is also reflected in the 
situation for store employees  Within Axfood, extensive preventive 
security work is being conducted, including training, establishment 
of procedures, and deployment of technical and human resources 
to deal with various situations, such as shoplifting, fraud, threats 
and violence 
(I) Climate and environmental risks
The risk scenario with respect to climate and environmental mat­
ters is multi-faceted and covers brand issues, availability of food 
ingredients as well as costs that may arise as a result of political 
decisions  Moreover, the development toward more environmen­
tally conscious consumers, combined with the risk of an inability to 
be sufficiently fast at adapting the assortment to changed expec­
tations, could lead to lower competitiveness  However, risks are 
also opportunities for those in the industry that are far ahead  For 
more information about climate and environmental risks, see the 
chapter concerning climate-related financial risks and opportuni­
ties in the Sustainability Report on pages 90–91

RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
(J) Liability and trust risks
Axfood is one of the leading players in the Swedish food retail 
industry, and its ability to meet stakeholders’ expectations in 
terms of quality, transparency, and compliance with laws and 
standards as well as social and ethical norms is therefore crucial 
for maintaining a high level of credibility  Examples of issues dealt 
with on a daily basis include food safety, hygiene, the cold chain 
and product liability for products that could cause property dam­
age or personal injury  Should a serious defect be discovered in 
any of these areas, there is a risk that the Group would be exposed 
to financial loss as well as damage to the brand  Axfood works 
actively with these issues, for example, through extensive internal 
inspection programmes at stores and quality assurance of private 
label products  As part of the inspection programmes, stores con­
duct certain daily arrival controls and temperature controls in vari­
ous parts of the store  Clear procedures are in place, such as for 
handling unpackaged foods to ensure that food hygiene is main­
tained and to uphold the integrity of the cold chain  Failures in the 
environmental area, such as having excessively high levels of pes­
ticides in foods or unsuitable chemicals in other products, could 
undermine trust in Axfood’s brands, private label products and the 
Group’s various concepts  The quality assurance process of pri­
vate label products involves imposing requirements on food and 
product safety during the manufacturing of goods  The contents 
of the products, in the form of ingredients and additives as well as 
sensory qualities such as taste experience are reviewed and anal­
ysed for every individual product  For Axfood’s competitiveness, it 
is important to continually develop the assortment according to 
customers’ needs and preferences  This can entail, for example, 
offering sustainable foods such as organic and vegetarian prod­
ucts  Axfood also has a large assortment of food with the “Från 
Sverige” (From Sweden) marking  Weak goal fulfilment in the area 
of sustainability could, over time, undermine customers’ trust in 
the Axfood brand and the various food concepts 
(K) Pandemics
For Axfood, the health and safety of its employees and custom­
ers is the top priority, at the same time as the company is to live 
up to its societal responsibility to deliver food  The Covid-19 
pandemic provided lessons when it comes to managing the 
spread of infection with a number of measures and restrictions 
of different kinds  The risks that the pandemic gave rise to, 
including the risk of disruptions in the logistics chain, supplier 
risks and employee risks, could be managed within existing 
organisations in the Group without any significant disruptions 
in operations 
(L) Risk of labour market conflicts
There is a risk that labour market conflicts, such as a strike or 
lockout in any area of the business, could result in operational 
disruptions  Negotiations of collective bargaining agreements 
for Axfood’s operations are conducted through the auspices of 
the Swedish Trade Federation, in which Axfood is a member 
(M) Risks of errors in the financial reporting
Axfood continuously analyses and assesses risks that could 
lead to errors in the Company’s financial reporting  Each year, 
the Board of Directors decides which risks are material to take 
into consideration in order to ensure a high level of internal 
control over financial reporting  A more detailed description 
of the work with internal control is included in the Corporate 
Governance Report 
Financial risks
Axfood is exposed to financial risks in the form of financing and 
refinancing risks, liquidity risks, interest rate risks, currency risks 
and credit risks  Every year, the Board of Directors adopts a 
Group-wide finance policy that regulates the delegation of 
responsibility for financial matters between the Board, the 
President and CEO, the CFO, Group Treasury and other Group 
companies  Group Treasury reports monthly to the CFO with a 
follow-up of the finance policy  The same report is also pre­
sented to the Board four times a year  For further information 
about financial risks, see Note 22

Clear strategy in a non-­
cyclical and growing market
The food retail market is rela­
tively unaffected by economic 
swings and is driven largely by 
population growth and inflation  
Annual market growth has his­
torically been stable at 2–3%  
However, in the past few years 
it has been impacted by the 
pandemic and substantial food 
inflation  Axfood has a clear 
strategy with concrete priorities 
in six focus areas: customer 
offering, customer meeting, 
expansion, supply chain, work 
approach and people  The goal 
is to grow faster than the market 
with a long-term operating 
margin of at least 4 5% 
Axfood consists of a variety of operations and concepts with 
strong market positions that meet varying customer needs  ­
Willys 
is the leader in the discount segment, and Hemköp is a strong player 
in traditional grocery  With Tempo, Handlar’n and ­
Matöppet, Axfood 
also has a position in mini-marts  Eurocash operates cross-border 
shopping stores towards Norway, and with its partnership with 
City Gross, Axfood also has a presence in the hypermarket segment  
Middagsfrid simplifies everyday life for online customers with pre-
planned meal kits, and with its holding in Mathem, Axfood is also 
represented in pure-play online retail for groceries with home 
delivery  Snabbgross and Urban Deli hold a position in the café and 
restaurant industry, and Apohem is active in the online pharmacy 
market  With a clear expansion plan, a focus on price value in 
physical stores and in e-commerce, and the continuous develop­
ment of the customer offering, customers’ evolving behaviours are 
being met 
Sustainable economies of 
scale and close collaboration
Economies of scale and cost effi­
ciency are achieved through close 
collaboration within Axfood 
between the Group companies 
and the central support functions  
Dagab is the joint purchasing and 
logistics company, creating con­
ditions for price value, quality and 
sustainability  Efficient and mod­
ern logistics convey many advan­
tages and lay the foundation for 
profitable growth and a competi­
tive offering  Axfood’s common 
IT company have a crucial role in 
the Group’s digital development, 
automation and data-driven work 
approach to meet future needs 
Strong financial position 
and stable cash flow
Axfood has a solid balance 
sheet and a stable cash flow 
with efficient management of 
working capital  According to 
Axfood’s dividend policy, the 
shareholder dividend is to be at 
least 50% of profit after tax and 
is to be paid out on two occa­
sions  During the last five years, 
the dividend yield has on an 
annual basis averaged just over 
3%  Axfood’s gearing is low, and 
excluding the accounting effects 
of IFRS 16, the Group’s net debt 
divided by EBITDA amounted to 
0 0 at year-end 2023 
Positive force in society
Axfood has long been working 
to be a positive force in society  
This means offering affordable, 
good and sustainable food for 
everyone and being an inclusive 
business that is conducted in a 
responsible way, not least with 
respect to reducing the Group’s 
climate impact  Axfood is taking 
the lead in promoting sustain­
able and healthy food in 
­
Sweden, and innovative, sus­
tainable and healthy products 
are being launched through the 
private label assortment

stores, but also stores operating under the Tempo, Handlar’n and 
Matöppet brands 
Important events
The market dynamics in 2023 were largely characterised by high 
inflation and, as a result, changing consumer behaviour with a strong 
focus on price value and affordability  In this market environment, 
Axfood’s growth was double that of the market with a large influx of 
new customers  Willys, with its unique concept and leading position 
within the discount segment, benefited most from this trend, but 
Hemköp also performed well and grew slightly more than the market 
At the start of the year, the first deliveries to stores from the 
Group’s new, highly automated logistics centre in Bålsta outside 
Stockholm began  The ramp-up of the logistics centre has been 
gradual, with first outbound deliveries of dry goods , and later also 
deliveries of goods from the refrigerated assortment  During the 
year, Axfood’s earnings were charged with parallel operating costs 
related to the restructuring of the logistics operations  The logistics 
centre is expected to be fully operational in 2024  In addition to the 
logistics centre in Bålsta, the group’s logistics platform was also 
strengthened elsewhere as the automation solution at the new fruit 
and vegetable warehouse in Landskrona was fully installed  
Employees
The average number of employees during the year was 13,185 
(12,772)  The gender breakdown among employees was 52% (52) 
women and 48% (48) men  The share of employees in the retail 
operations was 66% (65), while the share who work in the wholesale 
operations was 30% (31)  
Axfood’s target is for at least 20 percent of the Group’s managers 
to have an international background  During the year, 18% (17) of 
managers and 29% (29) of employees in the Group had an inter-
national background  Gender equality is also part of diversity work, 
and the target is to achieve an even gender breakdown in manage­
ment positions  In 2023, the share of women in management 
positions was 51% (51)1)  The share of women on the Executive 
Committee was 55% (55) 
Axfood AB with subsidiaries are bound by at least one of the six 
nationwide collective agreements concluded for the retail trade, 
warehousing and e-commerce, transport, food workers, hotel and 
restaurant workers, and salaried employees  All employees are 
­
covered by collective agreements, which regulate pay and terms of 
employment  Every year, mapping of salaries is conducted within the 
Group to prevent inequitable differences in salary and benefits

Material risks
Like all business activities, Axfood’s business is exposed to risks  
Risks are something that can affect Axfood’s operations negatively  
Managed properly, however, they can also add value  How risks are 
managed is of great significance  Axfood breaks down the Group’s 
risks into operational, strategic and financial risks  
In recent years, the risk scenario has been impacted by a number 
of external factors, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, growing criminal­
ity, and increased crisis preparedness in society  Managing changing 
external factors is a continuous part of the risk management pro­
cess  
The operational and strategic risks that could have the greatest 
impact on the Group are IT and information security risks, the risk of 
disruptions in the logistics chain, and liability and trust risks  Axfood’s 
operational and strategic risks are described on pages 28–32  
Financial risks are described in Note 22  
Climate and environmental risks are included in operational risks  
The risk scenario in this is multi-faceted and covers brand issues, 
availability of food ingredients as well as costs that may arise as a 
result of political decisions  One way to address challenges is 
through purchasing from different production areas  A detailed 
description of Axfood’s work with climate and environmental risks is 
provided in the Sustainability Report 
Share repurchases and transfers, and holdings of treasury 
shares
The 2023 AGM resolved to adopt a new long-term share-based 
incentive programme that runs over a three-year period, LTIP 2023  
The programme essentially corresponds to earlier programmes, with 
an adjustment in the comparative group for measuring the total 
return for the company’s shares, and a decrease in the number of 
savings shares to the levels in LTIP 2021  Allotment was carried out 
for LTIP 2020 in April 2023 using treasury shares  
To secure the Company’s obligations under LTIP 2023, Axfood 
repurchased 155,000 shares for a total of SEK 37 m during the 
second quarter of 2023, at an average price of SEK 239 53 per share  
The holding of treasury shares thereby amounts to 1,065,652 shares, 
which is sufficient to secure the delivery of shares for all of the 
incentive programmes  
A proposal has been drafted for the 2024 AGM to introduce a 
new long-term share-based incentive programme, LTIP 2024, which 
corresponds in all essential respects to LTIP 2023  The programme 
is proposed to include approximately 85 employees  1) 
The definition of “Share of women in management positions” has been revised 
to also include team managers  Comparison figures have been restated

Corporate Governance Report and Sustainability Report
In accordance with Chapter 6, Sections 8 and 11 of the Swedish 
Annual Accounts Act, Axfood has elected to prepare the statutory 
Corporate Governance Report and Sustainability Report separately 
from the statutory annual report  The Corporate Governance Report 
is presented on pages 116–125, and the scope of the statutory 
sustainability report is presented in the table on page 109  The 
Sustainability Report has been reviewed by Axfood’s auditors 
Future development
Axfood’s operations are conducted and developed based on a strat­
egy of growth-promoting and efficiency-enhancing focus areas 
To promote growth, the focus is on developing and offering an 
attractively priced assortment  Apart from growing sales at existing 
stores, key initiatives include continued expansion through more 
stores, the e-commerce roll-out and the establishment of new for­
mats centrally  To stay at the forefront, a culture is developed that 
enables the industry’s best employees to be attracted and developed  
The Group is continuing to become more efficient through a more 
data-driven work approach and additional automated solutions  In 
2024, the automation solution at the fruit and vegetable warehouse 
in Landskrona will be deployed and the Group’s new, highly auto­
mated logistics centre in Bålsta is expected to be fully operational, 
with increased volumes and the addition of the frozen assortment 
and e-commerce  In 2024 an upgrade of the back-office system in 
the stores will take place, which will simplify and streamline processes 
Investments in 2024 are expected to amount to between 
SEK 1,600 and SEK 1,700 m, excluding acquisitions and right-of-use 
assets, of which approximately SEK 300 m are attributable to the 
automation of the new logistics centre in Bålsta outside Stockholm, 
the distribution centre in Backa in Gothenburg, and the new fruit and 
vegetable warehouse in Landskrona  During 2024, Axfood plans to 
establish 10–15 new stores  Proposed disposition of profit
The Board of Directors proposes the following appropriation of the 
available funds:

The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 8 50 per share 
(8 15)  The dividend is to be split into two payments, SEK 4 25 per 
share in March 2024 and SEK 4 25 per share in September 2024  
The proposed dividend amounts to a total of SEK 1,834,109,498  
The amount stated is based on the total number of shares out­
standing in the Company less the Company’s holding of treasury 
shares on the date of publication of the Annual Report  This holding 
will change before the second record date, in part owing to allot­
ments under the LTIP 2021 framework and in part as a result of the 
proposal for a LTIP 2024, if the proposal is adopted by the AGM 
In reference to the above and to other information that has been 
brought to the Board’s attention, the Board is of the opinion that a 
comprehensive assessment of the Company’s and Group’s financial 
position entails that the dividend is justified in view of the demands 
that the nature, scope and risks in the business place upon the size 
of the Company’s and Group’s equity and upon the Company’s and 
Group’s funding needs, liquidity and financial position in general

Development during the year
Willys net sales for the year totalled SEK 43,757 m (37,451), a signif­
icant increase by 16 8% compared with the corresponding period 
during the prior year, which was more than double the market  Like-
for-like sales increased 13 9% (13 5)  The Willys chain’s strong devel­
opment during the year is mainly attributable to pricing and volume 
growth  As a result of high food price inflation, price value has become 
increasingly relevant to consumers, resulting in increased customer 
traffic  Willys continued to develop its offering and concept with an 
expansion through new stores and online and a modernisation of 
existing stores  Both total sales and like-for-like sales for Eurocash 
increased compared with the preceding year 
In total, 9 new stores were established during the year  The num­
ber of stores at year-end was 241 (232), of which 234 (225) were Willys 
and 7 (7) were Eurocash  At year-end, Willys offered online shop­
ping through 158 (149) stores  The share of private label products 
amounted to 34 2% (33 1) 
Operating profit amounted to SEK 2,077 m (1,859), corresponding 
to an operating margin of 4 7% (5 0)  The higher operating profit 
was primarily attributable to robust growth in like-for-like sales and 
healthy cost control  Operating profit was negatively impacted by a 
lower gross margin as well as higher personnel costs and rent levels 
Business highlights – High rate of new store establishments and re-establishments, 
and development of a new store concept  – The focus on e-commerce continued, with a focus on the omni­
channel experience and Willys Hämta  – The number of members in the Willys Plus loyalty programme 
increased significantly to closer to 3 6 million at year-end  – Food waste was reduced by more than 1,400 tonnes by offering 
customers waste-smart bargain boxes with fruits and vegetables 
and by 775 tonnes by clearance sales of daily-fresh bread  Food 
waste was further reduced through donations of 175 tonnes of food 
to charity organisations

Development during the year
Net sales at Snabbgross increased 12 5% during the year to 
SEK 5,317 m (4,727)  Like-for-like sales increased 10 4% (20 1)  
Snabbgross’s strong sales growth was mainly due to food price 
inflation and the recovery of the café and restaurant market after 
the pandemic  Developments in newly established stores and sales to 
consumers through the member-based Snabbgross Club store con­
cept also contributed to the performance  The café and restaurant 
market saw a slowdown in the second half of the year compared to 
previous high levels, which had a negative effect on sales for 
Snabbgross  Snabbgross’s accessibility through its store network 
and attractive customer offerings resulted in an increase in the 
number of unique customers 
In total, 1 new store was established during the year  The number of 
stores at year-end was 30 (29), of which 7 (5) Snabbgross Club 
Operating profit was SEK 265 m (252), and the operating margin 
was 5 0% (5 3)  The positive earnings effect from the strong growth in 
like-for-like sales was offset by costs related to new establishments 
and refurbishments, as well as higher personnel costs and rent levels 
Business highlights – Continued customer growth and now more than 100,000 active 
B2B customers  – Development of Snabbgross Club through store conversions in 
Växjö and at Gärdet in Stockholm  Growth in memberships was 
strong, and the total number of registered private customers was 
approximately 75,000 at year-end  – Investments in private label products with the brand Gastrino  – Ambitious sustainability efforts continued, including reducing food 
waste with a particular focus in 2023 on fruits and vegetables, 
sustainable stores and environmentally certified electricity  The 
operations became MSC-certified and ASC certified during the 
year  In addition, the assortment of sustainability-labelled products 
has been expanded, and during the year, Snabbgross switched to 
selling only organic bananas and stopped selling fruits, vegetables, 
meat and fish that have been transported by air

Development during the year
Dagab’s net sales for the year totalled SEK 74,175 m (66,999), an 
increase of 10 7%  The growth in net sales was mainly attributable 
to the increase in sales to food retail stores  External sales amounted 
to SEK 24,388 m (24,509) 
Operating profit amounted to SEK 1,021 m (978), corresponding 
to an operating margin of 1 4% (1 5)  Operating profit included items 
affecting comparability of SEK -249 m (-162), which pertained 
entirely to parallel warehouse operation during the transition to the 
new logistics centre in Bålsta  In the previous year, items affecting 
comparability comprised integration costs of SEK -120 m related 
to the integration of Bergendahls Food and structural costs of 
SEK -263 m related to the restructuring of the logistics operations  
In addition, items affecting comparability in the previous year 
included a capital gain of SEK 221 m for the sale of Mat se  Adjusted 
operating profit amounted to SEK 1,271 m (1,139), corresponding to 
an operating margin of 1 7% (1 7)  The higher operating profit was 
primarily attributable to strong growth and to synergy effects from 
the acquisition of Bergendahls Food  However, operating profit was 
impacted negatively by higher logistics costs as a result of lower 
delivery reliability, mainly due to high volatility in demand, and by 
negative currency effects 
Business highlights – Work on the new, highly automated logistics centre in Bålsta out­
side Stockholm proceeded  The facility went into operation in 
February and operations were ramped up throughout the year, 
first in the dry goods assortment and then in the frozen assortment  – The automation solution at the new fruit and vegetable warehouse 
in Landskrona was fully installed  – Deployment of large rooftop solar panels on the new, highly 
automated logistics centre in Bålsta and the new fruit and 
vegetable warehouse in Landskrona  – The green transition of the delivery fleet continued, and additional 
electric trucks became operational during the year  – 140 new products were launched within the private label 
assortment

segments  The increase in sales was attributable to 
high food price inflation and to a higher inflow of 
new customers  Store and online sales accounted for 
70% (66) of net sales and external B2B sales for 
30% (33)  Retail sales rose 14 3%, with a 12 0% rise 
in like-for-like sales  Volume growth, the price trend 
and positive mix effects contributed to this growth  
Online sales totalled SEK 3,285 m (3,141), an increase 
of 4 6% 
Operating profit increased 8 1% (14 7) compared 
with the previous year  The operating margin was 
4 1% (4 2)  Operating profit was positively affected 
by strong growth and good cost control, while a 
lower gross margin in the segments, the ongoing 
investments within the Group, increased rent levels, 
and higher personnel costs had a negative impact  
Operating profit includes items totalling SEK -249 m 
(-129) that have been reclassified as items affecting 
comparability in the operational earnings monitoring  
Net financial items amounted to SEK -315 m (-166), 
with a negative impact mainly from increased inter­
est expenses for leases  The tax expense was SEK 
664 m (564), corresponding to an effective tax rate 
of 21 9% (19 2)  Tax for the previous year was posi­
tively impacted by the tax-exempt capital gain on 
the sale of Mat se

Notes to the financial statements
1  Accounting principles
Axfood AB is a limited liability company registered in Sweden, with its registered office in 
Stockholm  The Parent Company’s shares are registered on Nasdaq Stockholm  The address 
of the head offices is SE-107 69 Stockholm, Sweden and the visitors’ address is Solnavägen 4, 
Stockholm 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Parent Company Axfood AB and the 
subsidiaries over which the Parent Company has control 
Axfood AB is a subsidiary of AxRetail AB, corporate registration number 556039-2226, with 
its registered office in Stockholm  AxRetail AB, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Axel 
Johnson Holding AB, corporate registration number 556245-2549, with its registered office in 
Stockholm, which prepares consolidated financial statements for the ultimate group  
The Annual Report and consolidated financial statements were approved for publication by 
the Board of Directors and President on 16 February 2024  The Group’s statement of profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income and statement of financial position and the Parent 
Company’s income statement and balance sheet are subject to adoption by the AGM on 20 
March 2024 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Interna­
tional Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) as endorsed by the European Union (EU)  Swedish Financial Reporting Board 
recommendation RFR 1, Supplementary Reporting Rules for Groups, has also been applied, 
which stipulates supplementary disclosures, in addition to the disclosures required under 
IFRS, that are to be provided in accordance with the provisions of the Annual Accounts Act 
The Parent Company applies the same accounting policies as the Group, except in the 
cases indicated under the section Parent Company accounting policies 
Basis of preparation of the financial statements
The consolidated financial statements are based on historical cost, with certain exceptions 
presented in the accounting policies  
The Parent Company’s functional currency is Swedish kronor (SEK), which is also the 
­
presentation currency for the Parent Company and Group  The financial statements are 
presented in SEK  All amounts are rounded off to the nearest million kronor, unless stated 
otherwise  
Estimates and judgements in the financial statements
Preparing the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the Board and Executive 
Committee to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of the accounting 
policies and the Company’s result and position as well as other disclosures in general  The 
actual outcome may deviate from these estimates and judgements  Judgements made by the 
Executive Committee in the application of IFRS that have a material impact on the financial 
statements, and estimates made that entail a significant risk of material adjustments to the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the subsequent financial year, are described in 
more detail in Note 2 
Significant accounting policies applied
The accounting policies presented are applied consistently in the Company’s published finan­
cial statements  
New or amended accounting policies 
Amended accounting policies and interpretations endorsed for application from 1 January 
2023 have not had any material effect on the consolidated financial statements  Amendments 
to IAS 1 with respect to the disclosure of accounting policies and amendment to IAS 12 with 
respect to deferred tax attributable to assets and liabilities that arise in conjunction with an 
individual transaction have only affected disclosures in note  
Pillar II
The Group is subject to the OECD’s Pillar II Model Rules, which have been enacted in Sweden 
through the new Top-up Tax Act (2023:875), which took effect on 1 January 2024  Under Pillar 
II, the Axfood Group is not an independent group but rather is part of the Axel Johnson Group  
The Axel Johnson Group has assessed the Group’s exposure to the legislation through a safe 
harbour test based on the latest available data, which is the 2022 Country-by-Country 
Report  Based on the safe harbour test, top-up tax is deemed to be zero  
Since the Pillar II legislation had not entered into force as of the balance sheet date, the 
Axfood Group has no related current tax exposure  The Axfood Group further applies the 
amendments to IAS 12 regarding the temporary relief with respect to the recognition of and 
disclosures concerning deferred tax assets and tax liabilities related to income taxes in accor­
dance with Pillar II  
New or amended accounting policies in 2024 and later
New or amended standards and interpretations that have been published and take effect in 
2024 or later are not deemed to have had any material effect on the consolidated financial 
statements  Segment reporting 
Segment reporting follows the internal reporting structure for reporting to the Executive 
Committee, which is the decision-making body within Axfood that comprises the chief oper­
ating decision-maker  The operating segments that have been identified are Willys, Hemköp, 
Snabbgross and Dagab  Joint-Group pertains to support functions such as the Executive 
Committee, Finance, Legal Affairs, Communications, Business Development, HR and IT  The 
Executive Committee reviews the segments’ operating profit or loss, both including and 
excluding items affecting comparability  
Items affecting comparability refer to financial effects in conjunction with major acquisi­
tions and divestments or other major structural changes and material non-recurring items 
that are significant for comparisons between periods  Items affecting comparability are only 
included in the operational monitoring of the Group’s operating segments and not in the stat­
utory reporting  Revenue
The Group primarily conducts retail sales of groceries to consumers through the chains Willys, 
Hemköp and Eurocash, and B2B of groceries through Snabbgross and Dagab  Sales in Willys, 
Hemköp, Eurocash and Snabbgross take place both in stores and online  Dagab’s sales primar­
ily comprise sales to intra-Group customers as well as sales to external customers  Retail and 
B2B sales are the Group’s main sources of revenue  Other revenue represents an insignificant 
portion of the Group’s total sales  
For in-store retail sales, revenue is recognised when the customer has paid for and received 
the product in the store  For online retail sales, the transaction price falls due for payment and 
revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the customer via home delivery or 
in-store pickup 
Hemköp has a customer loyalty programme in which customers earn points for purchases 
made, which provide discounts on future purchases  A contractual liability is recognised at the 
point in time the sale was made and revenue is recognised when the points are used or expire 
In Snabbgross, B2B sales are mainly conducted in stores  For cash sales, revenue recogni­
tion is handled in the same way as for in-store retail sales  In-store sales also take place on 
invoice, and revenue is recognised when the customer receives the product in the store  
Online B2B sales with customer delivery take place on invoice, and revenue is recognised 
when the product has been delivered to the customer’s designated delivery location 
For B2B sales in Dagab, revenue is recognised when control of the product has been trans­
ferred, which takes place when the product has been delivered to the customer  Products are 
mainly delivered to customers via distribution from Dagab, but can also be delivered directly 
from the supplier to the customer for certain types of products, so-called direct deliveries, 
within the framework of the contract negotiated by the Axfood Group  The assessment is that 
Axfood serves as principal for direct deliveries based on the contractual relationships that 
exist, whereby Axfood assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the contract with the cus­
tomers, has control of the products and is exposed to credit risk as invoicing takes place at all 
stages  Invoicing takes place in connection with delivery 
In the wholesale operations, discounts are typically recognised through a deduction on the 
invoice  Volume discounts are offered to some extent, based on accumulated sales over a 
period of time  Revenue from sales with volume discounts is based on the price stated in the 
contract, less expected volume discounts, with historical data used to estimate the expected 
value of the volume discounts  A liability is recognised for anticipated volume discounts in 
relation to sales through the balance sheet date 
Subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures
Subsidiaries are companies in which the Parent Company, Axfood AB, directly or indirectly has 
control  Control exists when Axfood is exposed, or has the right, to variable returns from its 
involvement in the company and has the ability to use its control over the company to affect 
those returns

NOTES
Note 1, cont 
Associated companies are companies over which the Group has a significant but non-­
controlling influence, typically through a holding of between 20% and 50% of the votes but 
also through other contractual relationships  Joint ventures refer to companies over which the 
Group has joint control through a joint arrangement  Participations in associated companies 
and joint ventures are recognised in accordance with the equity method  
Based on judgements regarding the Group’s influence, the holding in City Gross is rec­
ognised as an associated company, despite the fact that Axfood holds less than 20% of the 
shares in the company  Based on judgements regarding influence, the holding in Apohem is 
recognised as a joint venture, despite the fact that Axfood holds more than 50% of the shares 
in the company 
Employee benefits
Post-employment remuneration
Axfood has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans  Defined contribution 
pension plans are classified as plans in which Axfood’s obligation is limited to the contribu­
tions that the Company has undertaken to pay  The pension cost for defined contribution 
plans is charged against profit or loss as employees’ perform their services  
Plans that are financed and secured by the Company itself and defined benefit pension 
plans financed and vested through premium payments to insurance companies are classified 
as defined benefit pension plans  All defined benefit plans financed and secured by the Com­
pany itself are locked and all new vesting takes place through premium payments to insurance 
companies  Defined benefit pensions secured through premium payments to insurance com­
panies are recognised as defined contribution pension plans in accordance with Swedish 
Financial Reporting Board statement UFR10  Defined benefit pension plans financed and 
secured by the Company itself are calculated by an external actuary in accordance with the 
Projected Unit Credit Method  The calculations are affected by actuarial assumptions, such 
as longevity and inflation  Revaluation effects are recognised in other comprehensive income  
Retirement pension and family pension obligations for salaried employees in Sweden are 
funded partly through insurance with Alecta  According to pronouncement UFR 10 issued by 
the Swedish Financial Reporting Board (RFR), this is classified as a multi-employer defined 
benefit plan and the pension plan secured in Alecta is therefore reported as a defined contri­
bution plan  
Share-based payments
The Group has share-based incentive programmes in which settlement is made with the 
­
Company’s shares and where the Company receives services from the employee in exchange 
for equity instruments (performance shares) in the Group  The programmes cover three-year 
periods and entitle the participants to performance shares provided that the participants 
remain employed and have purchased and retain a certain number of shares in Axfood (“sav­
ings shares”) during the term of the programme, and that the performance targets are met  
The fair value of the share rights that the employee receives is calculated on the allotment 
date according to a calculation model based on Monte Carlo simulations  The share rights are 
valued based on the share price on the allotment date for the share rights  The vesting terms 
include both market terms and non-market terms  The calculated dividend is taken into 
account in the calculation model  The fair value of the allotted share rights is recognised as a 
personnel cost, with a corresponding increase in equity that is apportioned over the vesting 
period   During the vesting period, provisions are made for estimated social security contribu­
tions, and social security contributions are measured based on the share price on the 
accounting date  
Share repurchases carried out to fulfil the delivery obligation under outstanding share-
based programmes are recognised in equity 
Taxes
The Group’s total taxes consist of current tax and deferred tax  Taxes are recognised in profit 
or loss for the year except when the underlying transaction is recognised in other comprehen­
sive income or equity, in which case the associated tax effect is recognised in a corresponding 
manner  Deferred tax assets relating to deductible temporary differences and unutilised loss 
carryforwards are recognised only to the extent it is probable that they will entail lower tax 
payments in the future  
Leases
The Group leases premises for stores, warehouses and offices, mainly for its own use but also 
to a certain extent for sub-letting, mainly to retailer-owned stores  The leases normally have a 
term of between three and ten years  The Group also leases vehicles and certain other equip­
ment  
When a contract is entered into, the Group identifies whether the contract is, or contains, 
a lease  For leases that include several components – lease and non-lease components – the 
Group allocates the consideration in accordance with the contract to each component based 
on the standalone price  In cases where it is not possible to distinguish between the compo­
nents, they are recognised as a single lease component  
Leases where the Group is lessee 
The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the commencement date of 
the lease  The right-of-use assets is initially measured at cost and depreciated on a straight-
line basis over the lease term  The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of 
the remaining lease payments during the assessed lease term  The lease term consists of the 
uncancellable period plus additional periods in the contract if, at the commencement date, it 
is determined to be reasonably certain that these will be used 
In most cases, leases include extension options and termination options which the Group 
may choose whether or not to exercise  Whether or not it is reasonably certain that an option 
will be exercised is determined on the commencement date of the lease  Since the initial lease 
terms are often long and it is not unusual for one of the parties to give notice of renegotiation 
in conjunction with the end of the lease term and the rent to be paid in the next period is there­
fore unknown until these renegotiations are completed, the lease term usually corresponds to 
the contractual lease term without extensions  The Group regularly reconsiders whether or 
not it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised, for example, in connection with 
major premises renovations 
The lease payments are discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate  The 
incremental borrowing rate is allocated to different terms, depending on the lease term  
The lease liability for the Group’s premises with a rent that is indexed is calculated based 
on the rent that applies at the end of the respective reporting period  When the cash flows 
change, the liability is adjusted with a corresponding adjustment of the right-of-use asset’s 
carrying amount  In a corresponding way, the liability’s and asset’s values are adjusted in 
­
connection with a reassessment of the lease term  
Lease payments for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less or with an underlying 
asset of low value are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term  
This also applies for variable lease payments, such as turnover-based rent payments  
Leases where the Group is lessor
The Group sub-lets leased premises, mainly to retailer-owned stores  When a leased asset is 
sub-let, the main lease and the sub-lease are recognised as two separate contracts  On the 
commencement date of the lease, it is determined whether the sub-lease is to be classified as 
a finance or operating lease  All sub-let premises have been classified as operating leases  
The Group recognises lease payments from operating leases as revenue on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term  
Intangible assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill, customer relationships, and current or capital­
ised costs for IT development  Intangible assets with definite useful lives are recognised at 
cost after deducting accumulated depreciation and any impairment  Eligible intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated 
useful life, starting from the date they are put in use  Goodwill and trademarks have indefinite 
useful lives and are not depreciated, but rather are tested for impairment annually 
Estimated useful lives:
IT development 5–10 years
Leaseholds Remainder of lease term
Customer relationships Length of relationship/contract
Other intangible assets 3–5 years
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost after deducting accumulated deprecia­
tion and any impairment  Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the assets  The useful life on land is indefinite and land is 
therefore not depreciated  Land is not depreciated  Useful life for improvement expenses for 
another party’s property is based on the remaining lease term for the underlying lease  
Estimated useful lives:
Equipment, tools, fixtures and fittings	
3–10 years
Store equipment 6–7 years
Buildings 20–50 years
Land improvements 20 years
Impairment
Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested annually to deter­
mine any need to recognise impairment  The carrying amounts of property, plant and equip­
ment and intangible assets are also tested when an indication of a decrease in value has been 
identified  Estimates of the value of goodwill and other assets are based on the cash-generat­
ing units’ value in use  Value in use is based on cash flows after tax that are estimated to be 
generated during the remaining useful life of the units, with an assumption of infinite useful 
life  To calculate value in use, future cash flows are discounted using a rate corresponding to 
Axfood’s estimated weighted cost of capital, meaning the weighted sum of the required rate 
of return on equity and the cost of externally borrowed capital

NOTES
Note 1, cont 
Financial instruments
Financial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost, fair value through other com­
prehensive income, or fair value through profit or loss based on the Group’s business model 
for managing the asset and the asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics  Financial liabili­
ties are classified as measured at amortised cost or at fair value through profit or loss  
On initial recognition, an irrevocable choice can be made for individual investments in 
equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value to recognise subsequent 
changes in fair value in other comprehensive income  Axfood has chosen to classify the hold­
ing in Mathem as a financial asset measured at fair value through other comprehensive 
income 
For trade receivables, the simplified method is used to measure expected credit losses  The 
Group has prepared a loss reserve matrix to measure expected credit losses for trade receiv­
ables, which is based on an analysis of actual bad debts during the last three years, taking the 
current situation into consideration  Trade receivables are recognised net including expected 
credit losses  
Financial derivative instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group holds financial derivative instruments to hedge foreign currencies  After initial rec­
ognition, derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss  The Group identifies 
certain derivatives as hedge instruments to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes 
in exchange rates associated with highly probable transactions  When a derivative is identi­
fied as a cash flow hedge instrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the 
derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and is accumulated in the hedging 
reserve  Ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in 
profit or loss  Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge liabilities against exchange rate 
risk  Hedge accounting is not used to protect against currency risk, since a financial hedge is 
reflected in the reporting in that both the underlying transaction and the hedge instrument 
are recognised at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date, and changes in 
exchange rates are recognised in profit or loss  
Inventories
Inventory consists of finished products and goods for resale  Cost consists of the purchase 
price less supplier discounts attributable to articles in stock  In addition to the purchase price, 
other direct costs for bringing the products to their current location and condition are also 
included  Cost is calculated through application of the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle  
Statement of cash flows
The statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the indirect method  
Parent Company accounting policies
The Parent Company reports in accordance with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act 
(1995:1554) and Swedish Financial Reporting Board recommendation RFR 2, Reporting for 
Legal Entities  In accordance with RFR 2, the Parent Company is to apply all IFRS endorsed by 
the EU as far as possible within the framework of the Annual Accounts Act, taking into consid­
eration the connection between accounting and taxation  The main differences between the 
Parent Company’s and Group’s accounting policies are described below  
Application of new and amended accounting policies 
Unless stated otherwise below, the Parent Company’s accounting policies in 2023 have been 
amended in accordance with what is stated for the Group 
Amended accounting policies 2024 and later
New or amended standards and interpretations that have been published and take effect in 
2024 or later are not deemed to have had any material effect on the Parent Company’s finan­
cial statements 
Subsidiaries and associated companies
Participations in subsidiaries and associated companies are recognised in accordance with 
the cost method  All holdings are recognised as financial assets, and earnings from dividends 
are recognised as profit from financial items 
Leases
The Parent Company does not apply IFRS 16, in accordance with the exception in RFR 2  In its 
capacity as a lessee, the Parent Company recognises lease payments as an expense on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not rec­
ognised in the balance sheet 
Financial instruments
In view of the connection between reporting and taxation, the rules on financial instruments 
in IFRS 9 are not applied for financial instruments in the Parent Company as a legal entity  
Financial assets are measured at cost less impairment, and financial current assets are mea­
sured at the lower of cost or net realisable value 
Financial guarantees
The Parent Company applies a relief rule in the application of IFRS 9 pertaining to financial 
guarantee agreements pledged for the benefit of subsidiaries and associated companies  
The Parent Company’s financial guarantee agreements consist mainly of guarantees for the 
benefit of subsidiaries, which are recognised as contingent liabilities in the Parent Company 
Taxes
In the Parent Company, untaxed reserves are recognised in a gross amount without a break­
down into equity and deferred tax liability  In a corresponding manner, appropriations are 
­
recognised in a gross amount in profit or loss 
Group contributions
The Parent Company recognises Group contributions received and paid as appropriations in 
accordance with the alternate rule in RFR 2  
2  Key estimates and assessments
Measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities
The Group leases a large number of premises as well as vehicles and certain other equipment  
When entering into a lease, an assessment of the lease term and interest rate is carried out 
Extension and termination options
In most cases, leases pertaining primarily to premises include extension options and termina­
tion options which the Group may choose whether or not to exercise  Whether or not it is 
­
reasonably certain that an option will be exercised is assessed on the commencement date of 
the lease  Based on the fact that the initial lease terms are often long and it is not unusual for 
one of the parties to give notice of renegotiation in conjunction with the end of the lease term 
and the rent to be paid in the next period is therefore unknown until these renegotiations are 
completed, the assessment is normally that these options are not taken into consideration on 
the commencement date of the lease  The Group regularly reconsiders its assessments 
related to extension and termination options, for example, in connection with major premises 
renovations  
Discount rate
The Group has determined that the rate to be used for discounting future lease payments is 
the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, which consists of a swap rate for the current term 
plus a risk premium 
Guarantee commitments
Axfood AB has a guarantee commitment with NREP Logicenters pertaining to future rents  
Since it is extremely unlikely that the commitment will be utilised, the assessment has been 
made that the commitment is not to be recognised as a contingent asset or contingent liability 
Holdings in City Gross and Apohem
Axfood recognises its holding in City Gross as an associated company, despite the fact that 
Axfood holds less than 20% of the shares in the company  Axfood has determined that a sig­
nificant influence over City Gross exists based on the option agreement to gradually acquire 
additional shares in City Gross, which was entered into in connection with the acquisition in 
2021; on the fact that Axfood is represented on City Gross’s Board and material transactions 
occur between the companies; and on other contractual relationships between the companies  
Axfood recognises its holding in Apohem as a joint venture, despite the fact that Axfood 
holds more than 50% of the shares in the company  Axfood has determined that a controlling 
influence does not exist based on the fact that all significant decisions about the operations 
of Apohem are made jointly by the parties in accordance with a shareholder agreement  In 
accordance with the shareholder agreement, the Board is appointed with equal representa­
tion and a controlling influence is therefore not deemed to exist through the shareholder 
agreement either  Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets
In impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets, estimates are made regarding 
future conditions for the calculation of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units  
The recoverable amount is based on the Executive Committee’s estimate of future cash flows, 
which are discounted using an estimated average cost of capital  The estimates are based on 
various assumptions regarding price and volume trends, external factors such as inflation, 
changes in electricity and fuel prices, shortages of raw materials and packaging, disruptions 
in the transport sector, the anticipated competitive situation, and costs related to climate and 
environmental transitions due to decisions made, established goals and assessed risks  The 
Executive Committee is of the opinion that reasonable, possible changes in estimates and 
assumptions would not have such a large effect that they individually would reduce the 
recoverable amount to a value that is lower than the carrying amount  A sensitivity analysis 
is presented in Note 15

Remuneration of senior executives 
The Board’s Remuneration Committee makes decisions on salaries and other terms of 
employment for members of the Executive Committee, except for the President and CEO, for 
whom the Board in its entirety sets the level of remuneration and other terms of employment, 
according to the guidelines decided on by the AGM  
Variable remuneration for all senior executives including the President and CEO is based 
mostly on the Group’s earnings and performance, and partly on personal goals  Variable remu­
neration amounts to a maximum of 60% of the fixed salary  Short-term variable remuneration 
is expensed during the financial year and is paid out after the annual report has been adopted 
by the AGM  
In the event the Company serves notice of termination of employment for a senior execu­
tive, a notice period of a maximum of 12 months applies, on account  In addition, severance 
pay corresponding to a maximum of 12 months’ salary may be payable in certain cases, on 
account  For notice given by a senior executive, the notice period may be a maximum of six 
months, without any right to severance pay  In the event Axfood serves notice of termination 
of employment, the President and CEO is entitled to a 12-month notice period plus severance 
pay corresponding to 12 months’ salary, on account  In the event the President and CEO gives 
notice, the notice period is six months  
Axfood applies a retirement age of 65 for all senior executives including the President and 
CEO  The basic pension benefit consists of the ITP plan, where six members of the Executive 
Committee have a solution corresponding to ITP 1  In addition to this the Company pays 
defined contribution pension premiums corresponding to 30% of salary amounts between 
30 and 50 times the income base amount  One member of the Executive Committee has 
a pension solution where the total pension provision is 35% of fixed yearly cash salary less 
premiums for ITP 2  The President and CEO is entitled to retirement pension provisions corre­
sponding to 35% of yearly cash salary

Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, adopted at the AGM 
on 22 March 2023
The guidelines cover the President and CEO of Axfood and members of the Executive Com­
mittee, who report directly to the CEO  The guidelines do not pertain to remuneration decided 
on by a general meeting of shareholders, such as directors’ fees or share-based incentive pro­
grammes 
The guidelines are to be applied for remuneration that is agreed upon – and changes made 
to already agreed-upon remuneration – after the guidelines were adopted by the 2023 AGM 
The guidelines govern the decisions on remuneration that are made by the Board’s Remu­
neration Committee with respect to senior executives who report directly to the CEO and by 
the Board as a whole with respect to the CEO 
The guidelines’ promotion of Axfood’s business strategy, long-term interests 
and sustainability
Axfood’s purpose is to create a better quality of life for everyone, and Axfood’s vision entails 
that the Company shall be a leader in affordable, good and sustainable food  To achieve this, 
Axfood works according to a strategy of growth-promoting priorities and efficiency improve­
ment measures 
Added to this is a strong employee focus  Axfood’s strategies rest upon a values-steered 
culture and core values, on sustainability and on community engagement  Axfood’s business 
concept is to serve as a family of different concepts working together  This entails, among 
other things, that every concept shall offer the best customer experience for its target group, 
and that purchasing and logistics for all of food concepts are handled in a joint organisation  
This results in collaboration that creates an efficient and strong Group  Axfood’s purpose, 
vision, strategy and goals are described in more detail on the Company’s website 
Successful implementation of Axfood’s business strategy and capitalisation of Axfood’s 
long-term interests, including sustainability and health, requires that Axfood can recruit and 
retain qualified employees with the right competence  Achieving this requires that Axfood can 
offer competitive remuneration  The guidelines ensure that senior executives can be offered a 
competitive total remuneration package 
Axfood has both long and short-term goals  Axfood has established long-term share- based 
incentive programmes  These have been set by the AGM and therefore are  not covered by 
these guidelines  The programmes include the CEO, other senior executives, members of their 
management teams and key persons  The performance requirements used to assess the out­
come of the programmes have a clear link to the business strategy and to Axfood’s long-term 
value creation, and include a sustainability target (sustainability-labelled products)  For fur­
ther information about these programmes, including the criteria that the outcomes are based 
on,  see the Company’s website 
The variable remuneration shall aim to promote Axfood’s business strategy and long-term 
interests, including sustainability and health 
Forms of remuneration
Axfood shall offer remuneration that is in line with the going rate in the market and that is 
based on factors such as the importance of the work duties and the executive’s expertise, 
experience, performance and, as regards variable remuneration, achievement of previously 
set targets  Remuneration may consist of a fixed base salary, short-term variable remunera­
tion, pension benefits, insurance and other benefits  In addition, a general meeting of share­
holders may – and independent of these guidelines – decide on share-based and share 
price-related remuneration  
Fixed salary
Fixed base salary constitutes remuneration for a committed work contribution at a high pro­
fessional level that ultimately aims to create value-added for Axfood’s customers, sharehold­
ers and employees  Fixed base salary shall be attractive in comparison with the market and be 
based on the executive’s competence, experience and performance  Salaries are reviewed 
annually  Senior executives do not receive fees for board assignments in the Axfood Group’s 
subsidiaries and associated companies 
Variable remuneration
In addition to fixed base salary, variable remuneration may be payable  Variable remuneration 
shall be linked to measurable and predetermined criteria that are formulated to promote the 
Company’s business strategy and long-term interests, including sustainability  The criteria 
shall be adopted annually by the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors  Vari­
able remuneration shall be based on the achievement of Axfood’s – and where applicable, the 
subsidiary’s – targets for earnings and sales growth as well as the executive’s personal goals 
for the financial year  The measurement period is one year, and the remuneration can amount 
to a maximum of 60% of fixed base salary  
Additional variable remuneration may be payable under extraordinary circumstances, pro­
vided that such extraordinary arrangements are only made at the individual level for the pur­
pose of recruiting or retaining executives, or as remuneration for an extraordinary work con­
tribution on top of the person’s normal work duties  Such remuneration may not exceed an 
amount corresponding to 50% of fixed annual salary and may not be awarded more than once 
a year per individual  Decisions on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors 
following preparation by the Remuneration Committee 
When the measurement period for fulfilment of the criteria for payment of variable cash 
remuneration has ended, it shall be assessed and determined to what extent the criteria have 
been met  In the annual evaluation, the Remuneration Committee – or the Board, where appli­
cable – can adjust the targets and or remuneration for both positive and negative extraordi­
nary events, reorganisations and structural changes or similar circumstances 
Variable remuneration shall not be payable if the Axfood Group has a negative result, 
regardless of whether the specific targets for a subsidiary and or the individual goals for the 
senior executive, where applicable, have been achieved 
Pension and other benefits
Axfood applies a retirement age of 65 for all senior executives 
For the CEO, pension benefits shall be in accordance with a defined contribution solution  
Variable remuneration shall not be pensionable  Pension premiums for defined contribution 
pensions shall amount to a maximum of 35% of pensionable salary (which corresponds to the 
fixed monthly salary multiplied by a factor of 12 2) 
Other senior executives shall have a defined contribution pension plan in accordance with 
ITP 1 applicable at the time  The premium for pensions under ITP 1 currently corresponds to 
4 5% of the portion of salary up to 7 5 times the income base amount and 30% of the portion 
of salary up to 30 times the income base amount 
Senior executives with ITP 1 and ITP 2 are eligible for an executive pension plan, meaning 
that an extra pension premium of 30% is paid for fixed salary portions (fixed monthly salary 
multiplied by a factor of 12 2) between 30 and 50 times the income base amount 
To compensate for the accrual effect that can arise for senior executives with ITP 1 due to 
the payment of short-term variable salary in a certain month, Axfood can, where appropriate, 
pay an extra one-time pension premium in cases where the fixed salary does not exceed 30 
times the income base amount (per month), although the payment of short-term variable sal­
ary combined with the fixed salary may not total more than 30 times the income base amount 
(current payment month)  This compensation is limited to a yearly one-time premium corre­
sponding to 30% of the difference between the employee’s fixed monthly salary and the cap 
for pensionable salary, currently 30 times the income base amount  Other benefits shall be of limited scope and may include, for example, disability, life and 
health insurance, and a car, travel and housing benefit 
With respect to employment conditions subject to rules other than those that apply in 
­
Sweden, with respect to pension benefits and other benefits, customary adjustments may 
be made to comply with such compulsory rules or local practice, whereby the overarching 
­
purpose of these guidelines shall be met 
Cessation of employment
For notice of termination served by the employer, the notice period may be a maximum of 
12 months  Fixed base salary during the notice period and severance pay may together not 
exceed an amount corresponding to two years’ fixed base salary  For notice given by a senior 
executive, the notice period may be a maximum of six months, without any right to severance 
pay 
In addition, remuneration may be payable for any non-compete obligation  Such payment 
shall compensate the executive for possible loss of income and shall only be made during the 
period that the executive lacks a right to severance pay  The monthly remuneration shall 
amount to a maximum of 60% of the executive’s average monthly income for the 12 months 
preceding the end of employment  The remuneration shall be payable during the time that the 
non-compete obligation applies, which shall be a maximum of nine months after the end of 
employment 
Salary and terms of employment for employees
Salary and terms of employment for Axfood’s employees have been taken into account in 
the drafting of the Board’s proposal for these remuneration guidelines  Information on the 
employees’ total remuneration, remuneration components and the increase in remuneration 
and the rate of growth over time has made up part of the Remuneration Committee’s and the 
Board’s decision-making documentation in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines 
and the limitations that emanate from these  The change in the difference between the remu­
neration to senior executives and the remuneration to other employees will be reported in the 
annual remuneration report  
Decision-making process for adopting, reviewing and implementing the 
guidelines
The Board is to prepare a proposal for new guidelines for remuneration to senior executives 
and submit the proposal for resolution by a general meeting of shareholders  The guidelines 
shall apply until new guidelines have been adopted by a general meeting of shareholders, but 
at most for four years  The Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee  
The committee’s duties include conducting preparatory work for the Board’s decisions on pro­
posed guidelines  The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate ongoing pro­
grammes and programmes concluded during the year for variable remuneration to members 
of the Executive Committee, application of guidelines for remuneration to senior executives, 
and applicable remuneration structures and remuneration levels at Axfood  The Remunera­
tion Committee’s members are independent in relation to Axfood and the Executive Commit­
tee  In the Board’s handling of and decisions on remuneration-related matters, the CEO or

other members of the Executive Committee are not present to the extent they are the subject 
of the matter at hand 
Departures from the guidelines
The Board of Directors may decide to temporarily depart from the guidelines entirely or partly 
if in specific cases there are special reasons for doing so and a departure is necessary to safe­
guard the Axfood Group’s long-term interests, including sustainability, or to safeguard the 
Group’s financial soundness  As stated above, it is part of the Remuneration Committee’s 
duties to conduct preparatory work for the Board’s decisions on remuneration matters, which 
also includes decisions to derogate from the guidelines 
Long-term incentive programmes
Axfood has long-term share-based incentive programmes (LTIP) that run over approximately 
a three-year period  The programmes are offered to senior executives and other key persons 
in the Group  The aim is that the programmes will strengthen the joint interest in achieving 
maximum long-term value creation in Axfood and facilitate Axfood in recruiting and retaining 
members of the Executive Committee and other key persons 
Participation requires that the participants buy or previously own a certain number of 
shares in Axfood (“savings shares”) and that the shareholding continues throughout the entire 
term  All participants have bought shares in Axfood at market price up to the predetermined, 
maximum number of shares for each category of participants  After the set vesting period, the 
participants will be allotted shares in Axfood, free of charge, provided that certain conditions 
are met 
If a participant’s employment ceases during the vesting period due to contractual or age-
based retirement, the allotment of share rights is reduced in proportion to the amount of the 
vesting period that had passed at the time of retirement 
The cost is allocated on a straight-line basis over a three-year period and includes social 
security contributions  The carrying amounts during the year have been affected by individu­
als who have left the programmes and individuals who have retired  
Repurchased shares 
To secure the Company’s obligation for under the long-term share-based incentive pro­
grammes, Axfood repurchases shares in accordance with the resolution passed at each AGM  
In 2023, Axfood repurchased 155,000 shares at an average price of SEK 239 53 per share, for 
a total of SEK 37 m  Allotment was carried out for LTIP 2020 in April 2023 using treasury 
shares  The holding of treasury shares amounts to 1,065,652 shares and is sufficient to secure 
the delivery of shares for all of the Company’s incentive programmes

Goodwill
Goodwill is broken down and tested at the level of cash generating units, which are identified 
as Axfood’s operating segments  The Group’s recognised goodwill is broken down as follows:

Impairment testing of intangible assets
Estimates of the value of the Group’s goodwill items and other intangible assets are based on 
the cash-generating units’ value in use  Value in use is based on cash flows after tax that are 
estimated to be generated during the remaining useful life of the units, with an assumption of 
infinite useful life 
For the first year, the future cash flows that have been used in calculating the respective 
units’ value in use are based on the business plan for the following year for the respective 
units  Thereafter, the cash flows are based on assumed annual growth of 2 0% (2 0)  The fore­
cast cash flows have been discounted to present value with a discount rate of 6 3% after tax 
(6 0), which corresponds to a discount rate before tax of approximately 7 5% (7 2)  The dis­
count rate corresponds to Axfood’s estimated average cost of capital  The estimated value in 
use exceeds the carrying amount for all units and no impairment requirement exists  
Sensitivity analysis
For the cash-generating units a 1 percentage point increase in the discount rate, a decrease in 
the EBITDA margin of 1 percentage point or a reduction in sales growth by 1 percentage point 
does not indicate impairment (no impairment)

Of Axfood’s net liability for defined benefit pension plans in Sweden, SEK 253 m (274) consists 
of obligations within the PRI system  All obligations are locked, which for Axfood’s part entails 
that all new vesting now takes place in the Alecta system  Obligations in the PRI system are 
unfunded pension plans, which is why these are recognised in their entirety as “Provisions for 
pensions ” In the previous year, the net liability the Company’s own defined benefit pension 
plans of SEK 5 m  
In addition to unfunded pension plans, Axfood has an individually funded pension plan that 
is managed by the Axel Johnson pension foundation  Axfood is entitled to benefits from the 
foundation in maximum amounts corresponding to the pension obligation  No fees were paid 
into the foundation during the year  
Of the plan members, 7 (8) are persons on disability pensions, 407 (441) are owners of 
paid-up policies and 1,216 (1,262) are retirees

Financial risk management
Framework for financial risk management
The Group is exposed to financial risks, which are described under the respective type of risk 
below  The Group has a Group-wide finance policy that regulates the delegation of responsi­
bility for financial matters between the Board, the CEO, the CFO, Group Treasury and other 
Group companies  The Group’s external financing and financial risk management is handled 
by Group Treasury of the Parent Company, Axfood AB  Group Treasury reports monthly to the 
CFO with a follow-up of the finance policy  The same report is also presented to the Board 
four times a year 
Financing and refinancing risk
Refinancing risk is defined as the risk that the Group at any given time cannot finance or refi­
nance the Group’s operations, or that it can only do so at a considerably higher cost  Respon­
sibility for the Group’s procurement in central financing matters rests with Group Treasury  
The Group’s external financing from credit institutions, mainly banks, is conducted by the Par­
ent Company, while subsidiaries finance their operations through the central Group account 
systems  
To limit the risk and financial loss associated with the Group’s inability to finance the 
Group’s operations at any given time, a minimum permissible average remaining duration of 
12 months has been set for the Group’s credit facilities  In addition, Axfood shall ensure that a 
maximum of 25% of requisite credit facilities falls due within 12 months  The guiding principle 
for the use of external credits, including leases, is to be the financial cost taking into account 
the risk limitation rules laid out in the finance policy 
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is defined as the risk of the Group being unable to meet its short-term payment 
obligations  Axfood mitigates its liquidity risk by coordinating the management of surplus 
liquidity and financing within the Group  In addition, liquidity risk is mitigated by Axfood ensur­
ing that a liquidity reserve is always available that can handle fluctuations in forecast cash 
flow during the coming 12 months  The liquidity reserve shall amount to a minimum of 1% of 
annual sales according to the most recently adopted financial statements and is calculated as 
the sum of available cash and short-term investments, and unutilised credit facilities at the 
end of every business day  Bank overdraft facilities may not be included in the credit frame­
work in the calculation of the liquidity reserve

Investment policy
The Group’s investment policy aims to ensure the Group’s ability to pay in the short and long 
term  Furthermore, the investment policy’s purpose is to reduce the Group’s external borrow­
ing as much as possible by coordinating the management of surplus liquidity within the Group 
and to achieve the best possible balance of net financial income and expense within the 
framework of this finance policy  Investments may only be made in highly liquid instruments 
with low credit risk, meaning investments that can be converted to cash and cash equivalents 
at any given point in time  As of 31 December 2023, the Group only had account balances in 
Swedish banks with a minimum rating of A– according to Standard & Poor’s, which are 
approved counterparties in the finance policy 
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is defined as the risk that changes in interest rates will have a negative effect 
on the Group’s earnings  Interest rate risk is managed through defined interest rate risk norms 
for Group Treasury and other Group companies  The Group’s interest rate risk associated with 
interest-bearing assets is to be managed by investing cash and cash equivalents in such a way 
that maturity dates for investments with fixed rates of interest match the Group’s known out­
flows and or payment of principal  The norm for Axfood is a remaining average term of fixed 
interest rates in the asset portfolio of 0–12 months  The goal is that no fixed-income invest­
ments are to be sold prior to maturity  
Interest rate risk and cash flow risk in the Group’s debt portfolio shall be limited  The norm is 
to have terms of fixed interest that entail a risk-neutral position  This is achieved by maintain­
ing short terms of fixed interest, which is defined as a remaining average term of fixed interest 
of a maximum of 12 months  This interest rate risk norm applies only when the Group has a 
need for long-term borrowing  
The effect on interest income during the coming 12-month period of a 1 percentage point 
increase or decrease in interest rates on interest-bearing assets amounts to +/- SEK 0 1 m 
(1 0) 
During the coming 12-month period, the effect on interest expenses of a 1 percentage point 
increase/decrease in the interest rate on interest-bearing liabilities would amount to +/- SEK 
100 2 m (95 4), mainly attributable to the Group’s recognised lease liabilities  
Commodity risk
Commodity risk is defined as the risk that changes in commodity prices will have a negative 
effect on the Group’s earnings  Within the Group, commodity risk arises partly in the goods for 
resale that the Group buys and in partly in operational overheads  Axfood has a policy to not 
hedge commodity price risks in the operations’ goods for resale  The Group’s overhead costs 
include, for example, electricity prices and commodity price risk for fuel  Electricity price is the 
most significant commodity risk, and changes in energy prices can have a major impact on 
earnings  The Group has entered into long-term delivery contracts for electricity for many 
years  The Group’s energy need for the next seven years is partly covered by long-term deliv­
ery contracts, which limits the Group’s sensitivity to short-term changes in energy prices

Currency risk
Transaction exposure in foreign currency arises in connection with the import of goods paid 
for in foreign currency and in connection with cross-border sales in Norwegian kronor (NOK)  
Transaction exposure also arises in connection with investments in non-current assets con­
tracted in foreign currency  
The Group’s finance policy prescribes that 100% of orders are to be hedged at the time the 
order is placed  Overheads in foreign currency are not hedged  Currency exposure to invest­
ments in non-current assets is hedged at 100% at the time of the contract in cases where the 
SEK equivalent exceeds SEK 10 m, unless the Board has decided differently  Approved hedge 
instruments are forward exchange contracts and currency swap contracts  
The Board has been made to deviate from the established guidelines to hedge the invest­
ments in automation in Bålsta with Witron, which means that hedging has taken place succes­
sively in accordance with a hedge scale whereby 100% of the remaining contract value is 
hedged on the balance sheet date 
The Parent Company did not have any exchange rate exposure during the year 
Sensitivity analysis regarding exchange rate risk
The sensitivity analysis shows the hypothetical impact of a 10% change in exchange rate 
against the SEK on cash flow and profit before tax, and before taking currency hedges into 
account  Currency hedges are always taken out no later than at the time orders are placed, 
and the hedge rate is always linked to the respective orders  Based on this value, the price in 
stores is then determined for the respective products

Credit risk
In the Axfood Group, credit risks and credit losses are mainly attributable to trade receivables, 
although some risks are linked to a few minor guarantee commitments  The Group has drawn 
up a credit policy that stipulates how customer credits are to be handled  The credit policy 
stipulates, among other things, the conditions for credit assessment, credit monitoring, and 
the handling of demands for payment and insolvency  Through coordination of credit monitor­
ing and its handling of security within the Group, Axfood ensures that its risk exposure and 
thus its credit losses are kept at a commercially acceptable level  
To reduce its credit exposure, Axfood has entered into netting agreements with its deriva­
tive counterparties, which means that receivables and liabilities can be offset in certain situa­
tions such as in the event of the counterparty’s insolvency  
There is no concentration of credit risks, neither through exposure to individual borrowers 
nor groups of borrowers whose financial situation is such that it can be expected to be 
affected in a similar manner by changes in the external environment  The Parent Company did 
not have any external credit risks at year-end 
To limit the maximum credit risk in trade receivables, Axfood has received collateral which 
on the balance sheet date covered SEK 241 m (216) of outstanding trade receivables  Collat­
eral received consists mainly of chattel mortgages, bank guarantees and guarantee commit­
ments  In 2023, a total of SEK 3 m (1) of collateral received was utilised to settle unpaid trade 
receivables  The credit quality of unimpaired receivables is considered to be good 
Trade receivables are recognised net, with expected credit losses based on the Group’s loss 
reserve matrix, which in turn is based on an analysis of actual bad debts during the last three 
years  The provision for expected credit losses amounts to SEK 15 m (17), of which SEK 15 m 
(17) pertains to trade receivables that are more than 90 days past due

cial liabilities measured at fair value amounted to SEK 45 m (0)  The entire amount is attribut­
able to Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy  
The carrying amount of the call option agreement entered into with City Gross in conjunc­
tion with the acquisition in 2021 amounted to SEK 0 m (0)  The call option agreement is rec­
ognised at fair value based on an assessment of the change in City Gross’s future sales and 
earnings performance 
The carrying amount of the participation in Mathem amounted to SEK 134 m (206)  During 
the year, the holding in Mathem was revalued by SEK -273 m (-635)  The revaluation was car­
ried out as a result of the decline in value that took place in the market in 2023  The valuation 
corresponds to an EV/sales multiple of 0 4 based on Mathem’s LTM sales as of 30 September 
2023  A 10% increase in the multiple would have resulted in a valuation of SEK 151 m, while a 
corresponding reduction of the multiple would have resulted in a valuation of SEK 117 m  
During the fourth quarter Mathem has entered into an agreement to merge with Norwegian 
Oda  Axfood’s current shareholding in Mathem will be transferred to a shareholding of just 
over 4 percent in the new combined company Oda Group  The transaction is expected to be 
finalised during the first quarter of 2024  The value of the participation in the new combined 
company is estimated to correspond to the value of the current participation

72 AXFOOD ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
Auditor’s report
To the general meeting of the shareholders of Axfood AB (publ)
corporate identity number 556542-0824
Report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts
Opinions
We have audited the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
of Axfood AB (publ) for the financial year 1 January 2023 to 31 
December 2023  The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of 
the company are included on pages 34-72 in this document 
In our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in 
­
accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 
December 31, 2023 and its financial performance and cash flow for 
the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act  
The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with 
the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of the group as of December 31, 2023 and their 
financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act  
The statutory administration report is consistent with the other 
parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
We therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders 
adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent com­
pany and the group  
Our opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consoli­
dated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional 
report that has been submitted to the parent company’s audit com­
mittee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11 
Basis for Opinions
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards 
on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Swe­
den  Our responsibilities under those standards are further described 
in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section  We are independent of the 
parent company and the group in accordance with professional eth­
ics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical 
responsibilities in accordance with these requirements  This includes 
that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited 
services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5 1 
have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its 
parent company or its controlled companies within the EU  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our profes­
sional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period  These 
matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming 
our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters 
Dependency on IT systems
Description of risk
Axfood sells groceries through the store chains Willys, Hemköp, Euro­
cash and a large number of collaborating stores  Wholesale trading is 
conducted through Snabbgross and Dagab holds the responsibility 
for assortment, purchasing and logistics  Well established procedures 
regarding secure IT operations and well-functioning IT processes are 
of the outmost importance for Axfood’s business as the large ­
volume 
of transactions means that completeness of transactions is critical in 
order to avoid material misstatements in the financial reporting  
Complete transfer between the cash handling system and the 
accounting system as well as between the inventory system and the 
purchasing system is of particular significance for revenue recogni­
tion, cost of goods sold and valuation of inventory  For further infor­
mation, please refer to note 1 regarding the group’s accounting poli­
cies and note 3 regarding operating segments 
Our audit procedures
Our audit included but was not limited to the following audit 
­
procedures: – Evaluating general IT controls in the cash handling system and 
accounting system as well as the inventory and purchasing system 
with the involvement of IT specialists, and – Auditing transfer of data between critical IT systems with the 
involvement of IT specialists  In the audit we have used analytic 
tools to enable the audit of large sample selections 
Valuation of goodwill 
Description of risk
Axfood reports goodwill in the consolidated accounts of SEK 3,606 
m as of December 31, 2023  Goodwill has resulted from business 
combinations  The value of the reported goodwill depends on esti­
mated cost of capital (WACC), sales growth and profitability devel­
opment in the cash-generating units that the goodwill relates to and 
is tested annually for impairment 
Valuation of goodwill is considered a key audit matter due to 
the risk of inaccurate judgements and estimates in the impairment 
testing, such as estimated future growth, profitability and discount 
rates, which could have a material impact on the group’s result and 
financial position  Management has not identified any need for 
impairment for 2023 
For further information, please refer to note 1 regarding the 
group’s accounting policies, note 2 regarding intangible assets, 
note 4 regarding acquired operations and note 15 regarding 
­
intangible assets  Our audit procedures
Our audit included but was not limited to the following audit 
­
procedures: – Auditing Axfood’s routines for impairment testing and evaluation 
of fairness and consistency of applied estimates and routines, and 
the integrity of calculations, – Verification of input data from budgets and business plans in the 
forecast period, – Testing of sensitivity analysis for each cash-generating unit, and – Audit of completeness and accuracy in relevant disclosures in the 
financial reports  
Fair value specialists have been involved in the audit procedures 
Other information than the annual accounts and 
­
consolidated accounts
The other information include the Remuneration report and pages 
1–33 and 75–134 in this document also including other information 
than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  The Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other 
information  
Our opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts 
does not cover this other information and we do not express any form 
of assurance conclusion regarding this other information 
In connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consoli­
dated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identi­
fied above and consider whether the information is materially incon­
sistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts  In this 
procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise 
obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise 
appears to be materially misstated 
If we, based on the work performed concerning this information, 
conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other informa­
tion, we are required to report that fact  We have nothing to report in 
this regard 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible 
for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with 
the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, 
in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU  The Board of Direc­
tors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal 
control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from mate­
rial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error 
In preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The 
Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the 
assessment of the company’s and the group’s ability to continue as a 
going concern  They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going 
concern and using the going concern basis of accounting  The going 
concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the com­
pany, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so  
The Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of 
Director’s responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things 
oversee the company’s financial reporting process 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free 
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to 
issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions  Reasonable assur­
ance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit 
conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when 
it exists  Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are consid­
ered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably 
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on 
the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts

73 AXFOOD ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
AUDITOR’S REPORT
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional 
judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit  
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the annual 
accounts and consolidated accounts is located at the Swedish 
Inspectorate of Auditors website: 
www revisorsinspektionen se/revisornsansvar  This description 
forms part of the auditor´s report  
We must inform the Board of Directors of, among other matters, 
the planned scope and timing of the audit  We must also inform of 
significant audit findings during our audit, including any significant 
deficiencies in internal control that we identified 
We must also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that 
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding inde­
pendence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other 
matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our indepen­
dence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or 
safeguards applied 
From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we 
determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit 
of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, including the 
most important assessed risks for material misstatement, and are 
therefore the key audit matters  We describe these matters in the 
auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes disclosure about 
the matter 
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Opinions
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of 
Directors and the Managing Director of Axfood AB (publ) for the 
financial year 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 and the proposed 
appropriations of the company’s profit or loss 
We recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the 
profit to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the 
­
statutory administration report and that the members of the Board 
of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability 
for the financial year  
Basis for Opinions
We conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden  Our responsibilities under those stan­
dards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities section  
We are independent of the parent company and the group in accor­
dance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have 
otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with 
these requirements  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient 
and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director
The Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropria­
tions of the company’s profit or loss  At the proposal of a dividend, 
this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable 
considering the requirements which the company’s and the group’s 
type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent com­
pany’s and the group’s equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity 
and position in general 
The Board of Directors is responsible for the company’s organiza­
tion and the administration of the company’s affairs  This includes 
among other things continuous assessment of the company’s and the 
group’s financial situation and ensuring that the company’s organiza­
tion is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and 
the company’s financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassur­
ing manner  The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing admin­
istration according to the Board of Directors’ guidelines and instruc­
tions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to 
fulfill the company’s accounting in accordance with law and handle 
the management of assets in a reassuring manner 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our objective concerning the audit of the administration, and 
thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit 
evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether 
any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in 
any material respect: – has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can 
give rise to liability to the company, or – n any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, 
the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association 
Our objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of 
the company’s profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to 
assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is 
in accordance with the Companies Act 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a 
guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally 
accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or 
omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the 
proposed appropriations of the company’s profit or loss are not in 
accordance with the Companies Act 
As part of an audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in Sweden, we exercise professional judgment and main­
tain professional scepticism throughout the audit  The examination 
of the administration and the proposed appropriations of the com­
pany’s profit or loss is based primarily on the audit of the accounts  
Additional audit procedures performed are based on our professional 
judgment with starting point in risk and materiality  This means that 
we focus the examination on such actions, areas and relationships 
that are material for the operations and where deviations and viola­
tions would have particular importance for the company’s situation  
We examine and test decisions undertaken, support for decisions, 
actions taken and other circumstances that are relevant to our opinion 
concerning discharge from liability  As a basis for our opinion on the 
Board of Directors’ proposed appropriations of the company’s profit 
or loss we examined the Board of Directors’ reasoned statement and 
a selection of supporting evidence in order to be able to assess 
whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act  
The auditor’s examination of the Esef report
Opinion
In addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts, we have also examined that  the Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and 
­
consolidated accounts in a format that enables uniform electronic 
reporting (the Esef report) pursuant to Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the 
Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528) for Axfood AB (publ) for 
the financial year 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 
Our examination and our opinion relate only to the statutory 
requirements 
In our opinion, the Esef report has been prepared in a format that, 
in all material respects, enables uniform electronic reporting 
Basis for opinion
We have performed the examination in accordance with FAR’s rec­
ommendation RevR 18 Examination of the Esef report  Our responsi­
bility under this recommendation is described in more detail in the 
Auditors’ responsibility section  We are independent of Axfood AB 
(publ) in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in 
­
Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in 
accordance with these requirements 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
Responsibilities of The Board of Directors and 
the Managing Director The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible 
for the preparation of the Esef report in accordance with the Chapter 
16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528), and 
for such internal control that the Board of Directors and the Manag­
ing Director determine is necessary to prepare the Esef report with­
out material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error 
Auditor’s responsibility
Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance whether the 
Esef report is in all material respects prepared in a format that meets 
the requirements of Chapter 16, Section 4(a) of the Swedish Securities 
Market Act (2007:528), based on the procedures performed 
RevR 18 requires us to plan and execute procedures to achieve 
­
reasonable assurance that the Esef report is prepared in a format 
that meets these requirements 
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but it is not a 
guarantee that an engagement carried out according to RevR 18 and 
generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect 
a material misstatement when it exists  Misstatements can arise 
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in 
aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the eco­
nomic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Esef report 
The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, 
which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of 
quality management including policies or procedures regarding com­
pliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and appli­
cable legal and regulatory requirements 
The examination involves obtaining evidence, through various 
­
procedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format that 
enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts and con­
solidated accounts  The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s 
judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstate­
ment in the report, whether due to fraud or error  In carrying out this 
risk assessment, and in order to design audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor considers those ele­
ments of internal control that are relevant to the preparation of the 
Esef report by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, but 
not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of 
those internal controls  The examination also includes an evaluation 
of the appropriateness and reasonableness of assumptions made by 
the Board of Directors and the Managing Director 
The procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report 
has been prepared in a valid XHMTL format and a reconciliation of 
the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated 
accounts 
Furthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of 
whether the consolidated statement of financial performance, finan­
cial position, changes in equity, cash flow and disclosures in the Esef 
report have been marked with iXBRL in accordance with what follows 
from the Esef regulation

Focusing on the environment, social issues and animal welfare is critical to creating long-
term, profitable and sustainable growth while also helping ensure the creation of economic 
value by strengthening brands, appealing to customers and making Axfood an attractive 
employer  Sustainability work is therefore a comprehensive and integral part of Axfood’s 
operations within three clear areas – food, the environment and people  The focus is on safe­
guarding the environment, the food that is produced and sold in stores, and the people who 
produce, sell or consume it 
Integrated sustainability efforts
The strategic direction of sustainability efforts is set by the Board, which addresses overall 
sustainability issues  Ultimate responsibility rests with the President and CEO, who in con­
sultation with the Executive Committee, the Risk Committee and the Head of Sustainability 
drafts strategies, guidelines and targets as well as annual and quarterly sustainability 
reports, and follows up the efforts  The Executive Committee is updated about this work 
and current issues on a quarterly basis via a sustainability forum led by the Head of Sustain-
ability, where they discuss and decide upon strategic sustainability targets and issues 
Axfood’s sustainability efforts permeate the entire organisation and are integrated into 
its operating activities  Sustainability coordinators and managers in the Group companies 
drive and continuously follow up Group-wide sustainability targets through action plans  
A central sustainability function, the accounting and finance department, internal networks 
and steering committees ensure that the joint targets are coordinated and that significant 
issues within the operations are prioritised  To improve employee awareness about sustain­
ability, the Group holds seminars and training courses 
Axfood works to make production 
methods and consumption 
patterns more sustainable 
Axfood works to minimise the food 
system’s climate and environmental 
impact, keeping it within the limits 
of what the planet can sustain 
Axfood works to improve work 
and social conditions throughout 
the entire food supply chain 
About this sustainability report

efforts and outcomes for the 1 January–31 December 2023 reporting period, which is in

Sustainability framework
Axfood’s sustainability efforts are based on a sustainability programme that includes a sus­
tainability policy and some 40 targets that are revised annually by the Executive Committee  
The targets are linked to Sweden’s Environmental Objectives and the UN Sustainable Devel­
opment Goals (SGDs)  The policy describes the direction and principles for sustainability, 
which are focused on preventive measures and should adhere to the precautionary principle 
to the greatest possible extent  Environmental efforts are focused on achieving a reduced 
carbon footprint and ensuring efficient use of resources with respect to products, recycling, 
transports, energy and use of premises  Environmental impact studies are performed prior to 
major structural changes in order to provide better information for decision-making  A wide 
assortment of sustainability-labelled products and clear and transparent consumer informa­
tion are to be provided to make it easier for customers to make sustainable choices  Read 
more about the sustainability programme on pages 110–114 
Governance documents and guidelines, such as guidelines about ethical conduct rules, prod­
ucts, sustainable establishments, biodiversity, sustainable IT and seafood, supplement the over­
all sustainability programme with information about how operations are to be conducted  
Axfood’s quality and sustainability strategy governs purchasing and assortment, and con­
tains requirements beyond legislation  This includes specific requirements in the areas of food 
safety, animal welfare, sustainability, product safety, the environment and health that every 
supplier must fulfil  The strategy is an important internal governance document when procur­
ing and assessing products and suppliers  Work with quality ensures that the assortment com­
plies with statutory requirements, Axfood’s policies and guidelines, the store chains’ assort­
ment strategies, and product labelling and certification  The quality and sustainability 
strategy is updated annually and approved by the Executive Committee  Individual proposals 
to depart from the strategy are handled in accordance with an established procedure 
The Code of Conduct guides social efforts
Social efforts in Axfood include supporting good working conditions in the entire supply chain  
To this end the UN “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework is applied along with the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  Axfood is a signatory of the UN Global 
Compact, a member of Amfori BSCI (Business Social Compliance Initiative), ETI (Ethical 
Trading Initiative) in Sweden and a partner in the Global Deal, and through these undertakings 
has committed to adhering to the UN’s fundamental human rights framework 
Axfood conducts its business in accordance with generally accepted business practices 
and high ethical standards in all relationships with all stakeholders  The Group’s Code of 
Conduct, which is resolved on annually by the Board of Directors, is fundamental to its opera­
tions, and lays out requirements and expectations for employees, suppliers and sub-suppliers  
The Code of Conduct is based on recognised conventions for human rights, working condi­
tions and the environment  It lays out Axfood’s positions and requirements for legal compli­
ance, conditions in the workplace, use of resources and impacts on local communities, the 
environment, animal welfare, ethical behaviour and anti-corruption  The Code of Conduct is 
integrated with Amfori BSCI’s code of conduct and is revised annually 
The employees concerned – mainly buyers of private label products – receive training in 
Axfood’s Code of Conduct, and all of the Group’s employees are informed about the most 
important parts of it  Suppliers are required to certify their compliance with the Code in 
connection with purchasing or, alternatively, Axfood accepts the supplier’s own code of 
conduct if it meets the same level  The Code is available in Swedish and English on Axfood’s 
website and can be provided to suppliers in around 20 other languages

Methodology
The purpose of the materiality assessment is to ensure that the right priorities are set for 
sustainability efforts based on current knowledge from Axfood’s own operations, the latest 
research and the Group’s potential to exert an influence  These priorities are to be made in 
accordance with stakeholders’ expectations and the Group’s own assessment  The material­
ity assessment that forms the basis of this year’s reporting was carried out in 2021  
The method used for the materiality assessment can be divided into two parts: stakehold­
ers’ views and Axfood’s impact  Stakeholders’ views have been identified through a dialogue 
based on several surveys, see the summary table on the next page  The objective is to balance 
multiple interests and expectations among the aspects identified  The other part of the analy­
sis takes Axfood’s actual impact into account  The current and potential impact of the Group’s 
own operations have been evaluated for several important aspects  The assessment also 
includes the effect of different outside factors on Axfood’s ability to pursue its business by 
examining Axfood’s ability to exert an influence and the financial impact of the aspects based 
on risk and probability  Axfood’s impact on its surroundings is based on research into the envi­
ronmental challenges and conclusions generally associated with the food industry, which are 
weighed against knowledge of operations and where exactly in the value chain that impact 
occurs  Taking into consideration both the actual impact of the business and the potential to 
make a difference ensures that the right priorities will be set in both the short and long term 
Material issues
The issues deemed to be material in the materiality assessment pertain to the entire Group 
and are presented in the table to the right  All aspects deemed to have from high to very high 
impact are reported  A detailed materiality assessment has been performed since some 
issues are more controversial than others and their significance can vary significantly among 
different stakeholders  Many of the aspects are interconnected, since the Group’s actions are 
usually intended to minimise its impact in multiple areas simultaneously  Axfood has come a 
long way in its work on some issues that are now basic reporting areas  Other areas, such as 
the environmental impact in agriculture, are a major challenge for both Axfood and the indus­
try as a whole, because reliable data is lacking in some cases 
Double materiality assessment
In 2023, Axfood carried out a double materiality assessment to determine material impacts, 
risks and opportunities for meeting future regulatory requirements  The assessment was car­
ried out in accordance with the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and 
the adopted European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS)  The materiality assessment 
followed the principle of double materiality, which includes impact materiality as well as 
financial materiality  The materiality assessment will serve as the foundation for Axfood’s 
sustainability reporting as of the 2024 financial year 
The table above shows which aspects are considered most important by Axfood’s stakeholders  Aspects associated with reduced 
­
carbon footprint are the most important  Above all, issues associated with food from sustainable agriculture, food waste and biodiver­
sity rank high with all groups  Work environment and working conditions are a priority issue for both suppliers and Axfood employees  
Sustainable fishing and good animal care are important issues to all stakeholders

A positive force in society
Axfood aims to be a force for positive change that takes the lead in promoting sustainable 
and healthy food in Sweden by influencing decision-makers, leading the way through its own 
initiatives and driving joint industry issues  Axfood’s company structure with different con­
cepts enables own initiatives that also result in important changes beyond its operations 
Initiatives where Axfood went first and others followed include country of origin labelling 
for meat, deposits for plastic fruit drink and juice bottles, and no longer selling fish and shell­
fish red-listed according to the WWF’s fish guide  Over the years, Axfood has driven important 
societal issues such as reducing the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry, abolishing tax on 
solar electricity for private use and stopping the use of oil palm derivatives in biofuel  In 2022, 
a proposal was presented to reduce or abolish VAT on sustainability-labelled products to 
­
benefit sustainable food production and consumption  Supporting public health through regu­
lated levels of sugar and salt, primarily in food where consumers do not expect them, is one of 
Axfood’s newer proposals for promoting healthier, more sustainable food in Sweden 
Many issues require cooperation in order to achieve sustainable solutions that contribute 
to change over time  Axfood therefore works with industry organisations and networks in 
order to achieve more extensive changes  Issues concerning food consumption or production 
rank high on the agenda  Producers and suppliers are also important partners for cooperation 
Axfood takes an active role within groups like Organic Sweden, which promotes the con­
sumption and export of organic products, and Sweden Food Arena, a venue for cooperation to 
promote an innovative, sustainable and competitive food retail sector  Axfood is a co-founder 
of “Matmissionen” (the Food Mission) along with Stockholms Stadsmission  Matmissionen is a 
group of subsidised grocery stores that enable financially disadvantaged people to shop at 
reduced prices while reducing food waste and providing opportunities for job training  Axfood 
also works with the organisation Generation Pep to promote healthy habits among children 
and young people through better food habits  The organisation will spread information about 
making healthier choices, and facilitate and conduct activities that encourage children and 
young people in this area so they can live a more wholesome, longer and healthier life  When it 
comes to reduced climate impact, the Haga Initiative business network, which Axfood initi­
ated, is an important arena for driving and inspiring positive change  For example, in addition 
to contributing to more sustainable consumption by choosing good and sustainable products 
when shopping, Willys and Hemköp customers can donate their bottle deposit money to Save 
the Children or SOS Children’s Villages 
Axfood engages in dialogue with politicians and authorities in order to increase their 
knowledge about the food retail industry and drive development within sustainability and 
health issues  Each year, Axfood publishes the Food 2030 report, the Group’s proposal for a 
sustainable food strategy for Sweden (read more in the text box to the right)

als for politicians, authorities and industry, 
was published in 2023  The proposals range 
from reducing food waste and expanding 
grazing rights to investing in processing and 
public health, and the report also addresses 
the need of a fourth action plan for the food 
strategy  The report is available in Swedish

Food
Food is at the heart of Axfood’s business  Since food has a large 
impact on the environment as well as people, it is important to 
change production methods and consumption patterns  Axfood’s 
sustainability efforts in this area are reported under the focus 
areas sustainable choices, food waste and good proteins 
Sustainable choices
Sustainability labelling helps consumers make sustainable and healthy choices  A varied 
assortment that includes information on the source and ingredients allows consumers to 
choose products that are made in a way that takes both environmental and social aspects 
into account  
The target is for the share of sustainability-labelled products to amount to at least 30% 
of Axfood’s retail sales by 2025 the latest, a target that is part of the Group’s incentive pro­
gramme for senior executives  Consumers are to be guided toward healthier and more sus­
tainable choices while the assortment is to be developed and become more sustainable  
Organic products have several advantages and contribute to reduced use of chemicals and 
synthetic fertilisers while prioritising the well-being of animals and promoting biodiversity  
Axfood’s goal is for the share of organic products to amount to at least 10% of food sales by 
2025 the latest  As part of the Group’s efforts to contribute to better social conditions and 
terms for the people who work in production, a target has been established for increasing 
sales of Fairtrade certified products 
The share of sustainability-labelled products relative to retail sales is reported externally 
on a quarterly and annual basis  Measurement highlights the assortment’s gradual contribu­
tion to more sustainable consumption  Follow-up is carried out at the store chain and assort­
ment category levels to take into account the varying conditions at the Group companies  
Food waste
Food waste occurs throughout the entire food supply chain  It is a waste of resources when 
food that is grown, processed, transported and packaged is thrown away  Axfood’s target is 
a 50% reduction in food waste for own operations by 2025, compared with 1 7% for the base 
year 2015  Results are reported annually as a share of total food sales  
Measures to reduce food waste vary within Axfood’s group companies  The most important 
measures involve optimising orders and reducing prices for products that are nearing their 
best-before dates or are believed to be hard to sell at regular prices for other reasons  To the 
greatest extent possible, food that cannot be sold is donated to charity  Store employees 
report food waste through an internal database using handheld computers  Consolidation 
at the Group level is conducted centrally 
The new Swedish waste legislation that took effect on 1 January 2024 and stipulates that 
packaging is to be separated from its contents will likely facilitate efforts to avoid food waste  
In 2023, a development project involving some 25 stores showed that a substantial reduction 
of food waste could be achieved through sales-promoting measures and donations  2 8%

Axfood also works with other players in the food industry to reduce food waste  More than 150 
of the Group’s stores and warehouses collaborate with approximately 125 various social 
organisations and donate food that they have not been able to sell  Axfood is a co-founder of 
“Matmissionen” (the Food Mission), subsidised grocery stores that sell food that would other­
wise be discarded  Together with other players in the food retail industry, Axfood has 
expanded the initiative’s operations through a collaboration with the Swedish Food Retailers 
Federation and several suppliers  Today, there are a total of seven Matmissionen stores in 
Stockholm county  Willys is a co-founder of two Matmissionen stores in Malmö and two subsi­
dised grocery stores under the name Maträtt in Gothenburg  Axfood was the first company 
to begin a partnership with the Swedish food bank network (Svenska matbanksnätverket) in 
2023  The organisation matches local stores with food banks and provides administrative 
support and advice for making it easier to donate food 
Good proteins
Animal proteins are vital nutrients that have a large impact on the climate and the environ­
ment  By offering sustainably produced plant-based products that are good both for health 
and the climate, Axfood can contribute to more sustainable consumption  The goal is for all 
fish and shellfish sold in Axfood’s stores to be ecolabelled or green-listed according to the 
WWF’s fish guide by 2025, and for meat to have essential animal protection certifications  
This goal has not been met for Swedish beef, however, and Axfood is thus working with the 
industry to achieve certification  Axfood sets basic requirements already in connection with 
the procurement process with respect to clear labelling of the country of origin and product 
traceability 
Meat and poultry
Axfood’s quality and sustainability strategy lays out clear guidelines for suppliers of private 
label products regarding good animal care and low use of antibiotics in meat, dairy produc­
tion as well as aquaculture  The animal care requirements are based on EU animal protection 
legislation and are quality assured and audited through product labelling as well as third-
party certification of primary producers of all types of animals  With the exception of meat 
from natural grazing and the Svenskt Sigill, Svenskt Sigill Klimatcertifierad and KRAV labels, 
Swedish beef lacks animal protection certification  Axfood therefore advocates that the 
certification IP Nöt and Mjölk Grundcertifiering be introduced for Swedish producers 
Follow-up of compliance with Axfood’s quality and sustainability strategy is conducted 
through inspections to see how animals are raised and handled during slaughter  Whenever 
possible, audits are conducted by independent accredited companies, but can be performed 
by the Group’s own quality specialists when necessary  
Axfood cooperates with other members of the Swedish Food Retailers Federation to 
reduce the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry in order to help improve livestock farming 
and reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance  None of Axfood’s store chains sell eggs from 
caged hens or private label products with such eggs as ingredients 
Fish and shellfish
Axfood is to advocate for sustainable fishing that helps counter emissions, destruction of eco­
systems and acidification of fishing waters  According to Axfood’s guidelines for seafood, fish 
and shellfish from threatened stocks are not to be sold in the Group’s stores, which is ensured 
through close collaboration with suppliers  Fish must be traceable to its stock, fishing zone/
farm site and fishing method  The guidelines, published on Axfood’s website, summarise the 
Group’s requirements for seafood and govern work in the matter 
Axfood’s goal is for all fish and shellfish sold in the Group’s stores to be ecolabelled accord­
ing to MSC, ASC, KRAV or Svenskt Sigill, or alternatively to be green-listed according to the 
WWF’s fish guide, by 2025 at the latest  This is a challenging goal, since most fishing waters 
are fully utilised or overfished  Further challenges are that the goal also encompasses items 
containing extremely small quantities of fish or shellfish as well as its application to private 
label products as well as suppliers’ brands 
As part of its strategic work to promote sustainable fishing, Axfood partnered with the 
­
BalticWaters foundation to establish a unique new fish research laboratory  The laboratory 
will create conditions for new research and support for threatened fish species in the Baltic 
Sea  To be able to offer sustainable salmon from Sweden, Axfood supports Re:Ocean’s large-
scale, circular investment in land-based salmon farming  Approximately 10,000 tonnes of 
salmon are produced every year in one of Sweden’s largest-ever food initiatives  The first 
salmon from the facility are expected to be sold in Axfood’s stores in 2026 
Green proteins
Axfood shall reduce the assortment’s carbon footprint by offering products that contribute to 
more sustainable protein consumption, such as a wide selection of sustainable plant-based 
products  To achieve a transition to more plant-based proteins, new products are continually 
being developed that taste good and are affordable and sustainably produced  
Axfood’s goal is to promote more sustainable food production and consumption with a 
smaller carbon footprint per kilo of food sold, primarily through increased sales of plant-based 
products  In 2023, Axfood launched Nöt & Grönt, a new Keyhole-labelled mince from Garant  
It has equal amounts of mince beef with the “Meat from Sweden” label and vegetables, with 
under half of the carbon footprint of regular mince 
The assortment’s carbon footprint 
is to be reduced by offering 
products that contribute to more 
sustainable protein consumption

prices for products nearing their best-­
before dates, fruit and vegetable bargain 
bags and boxes in stores, and donations

This decline was largely due to the fact 
that caviar lost its sustainability labelling, 
together with increased in-store sales 
of salmon without sustainability labels  
A new purchasing procedure was intro­

The environment
The production of food contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, water 
stress, ­
land exploitation and loss of biodiversity  Axfood is to take the 
lead in promoting more sustainable food in Sweden, in which production 
methods and consumption patterns have the least negative impact 
possible on nature  Reporting on Axfood’s environmental programme 
focuses on ­
climate impact, smart use of resources, green transports 
and sustainable farming 
Carbon footprint
The risk scenario in the environmental area is multifaceted  A climate characterised by more 
extreme weather poses major challenges to primary production as well as the food industry 
and retail  Shortages of primary ingredients can make product supply more difficult, leading 
to higher prices  Climate policy measures require companies to adapt their operations to help 
slow the rise in global temperature  Axfood addresses these risks by making changes to the 
operations, through measures such as converting to fossil-free transports, using refrigerants 
without a climate impact, making strategic choices in new establishments and diversifying 
risk in purchasing both with respect to suppliers and geographically  Efficient use of resources 
is also necessary when it comes to energy use, water and recyclable materials 
Reduced carbon footprint
Axfood’s climate targets encompass both its own and suppliers operations as well as reducing 
the climate impact per kilo of food sold 
To promote more sustainable production and consumption of food, Axfood is to annually 
reduce its climate impact per kilo of food sold through changes to the sales mix  The largest 
contribution would come from decreasing meat consumption, which has the highest carbon 
footprint in all food categories, relative to other sales  In 2023, the estimated carbon footprint 
per kilo of food sold was 1 9 kilo CO2 equivalents (1 9)  Changing consumption patterns as 
a result of food price inflation, with increased meat consumption, impacted the sales mix  
Axfood’s own operations are to have net zero emissions by 2030 at the latest in order to 
help limit GHG emissions to meet both Sweden’s Environmental Objectives and the Paris 
Agreement  The definition of “own operations” includes emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and 
parts of Scope 3  The target states that emissions need to be at least 85% lower compared 
with the base year 2020  Emissions from purchased energy, refrigerants, business travel and 
transports are offset by measures to bind or counteract equivalent quantities of GHG emis­
sions in another area  In 2023, this was carried out through the company Eken Financing AB, 
which ensures that forests stand longer to bind more carbon, and in the projects Biokol se and 
Solvatten  Biokol se produces biocarbon that is mixed in farmland, while Solvatten provides 
people living in poverty with clean and hot water in a more environmentally friendly manner 
that reduces GHG emissions and counteracts the loss of biodiversity 
Reporting mainly focuses on Scope 1 and 2 emissions (direct and indirect sources of GHG 
emissions), where there is the greatest opportunity for Axfood to make an impact  The great­
est sources of emissions are transports between warehouses and stores as well as leaks of 
refrigerants from refrigerators and freezers in warehouses and stores  Scope 1 emissions

from purchased energy, the majority of which is green electricity from solar, wind and hydro 
power that Axfood purchases  To achieve further energy efficiency improvements in Scope 2 
emissions, numerous initiatives are being pursued to reduce energy consumption 
Scope 3 pertains to other indirect GHG emissions  In reporting, emissions include emissions 
from business travel, procured transports between warehouses and stores, waste, fuel pro­
duction and food sales  Scope 3 is challenging for the food retail industry as the majority of 
emissions arise in agriculture and are therefore difficult to affect or measure since they are 
largely the result of biological processes  Food comes from numerous different farms with 
various conditions as well, posing an additional challenge 
Axfood works continuously to improve the quality of the climate data that is available by 
making it more complete and by including more sources and units  The Group’s carbon foot­
print is reported yearly in accordance with the GHG Protocol guidelines 
Total emissions from own operations in 2023 amounted to 46,475 tonnes of CO2 equiva­
lents (44,571)  The change pertained mainly to Scope 3 and increased emissions from pro­
cured transports due to growing operations, which resulted in more kilometres driven using 
fossil fuels  Aggregate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions declined 9 6% to 14,420 tonnes of CO2 
equivalents (15,947), with a high share of green electricity contributing significantly to the 
result  The effect of not choosing green electricity is shown clearly in a comparison of mar­
ket-based and location-based emissions  If green electricity is not requested, the electricity 
that is delivered is significantly worse for the climate than the Nordic mix, i e  the residual that 
is left when the electricity with the smallest ­
climate impact has been delivered to those who 
have requested green electricity  Continued work to replace refrigeration and freezer units 
that cause unavoidable leakages contributed to the decrease in GHG emissions from the use 
of refrigerants 
To reduce emissions, work has been initiated to accelerate the phase-out of fossil fuel 
by switching to using renewable fuels and to using electricity in both own and procured 
transports from warehouses to stores  This means that emissions from fossil fuels will 
decrease in 2024 and be phased out in 2025 
The vast majority of Axfood’s carbon footprint comprises emissions from the food that the 
Group sells, which is reported in Scope 3  In 2023, these emissions amounted to 2,673,447 
tonnes of CO2 equivalents (2,498,085)  Changing consumption patterns as a result of food 
price inflation, with increased meat consumption, impacted the sales mix and contributed to 
increased emissions from food sales 
Axfood and other companies in the Haga Initiative prepare a joint emissions disclosure that 
presents the companies’ climate impact and measures to reach net zero emissions by 2030  
The goal is to encourage engagement and demonstrate the connection between ambitious 
climate strategies and increased profitability through a joint, transparent climate disclosure 
In 2023, Axfood worked on its opportunities to establish targets in line with the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi), work that is continuing in 2024  As a part of this review, work 
is under way to develop the existing climate reporting, primarily regarding Scope 3 emissions, 
and to map out and quality-assure emissions along the entire value chain in order to analyse 
which areas offer the greatest potential for emission reductions and to prepare a transition 
plan outlining how emissions are to be reduced

Smart use of resources
Axfood is contributing to a reduced carbon footprint and creating more circular flows by using 
and producing green electricity, energy recycling, selling surplus energy, using recycled and 
renewable materials, and recycling waste  
Axfood is to exclusively use green electricity  To promote efficient use of resources, elec­
tricity is to be produced by solar panels on rooftops of stores and warehouses, and surplus 
heat is to be captured to a great extent  In 2023, Sweden’s largest rooftop solar power facility, 
measuring approximately 80,000 square metres with a capacity of approximately 9 MW, was 
installed on the new logistics centre in Bålsta  Axfood is also building the country’s largest 
onshore solar park outside Hallstavik on 71 hectares of space with a capacity of approxi­
mately 64 MW  This initiative means that Axfood is helping to increase the amount of 
renewable electricity, which will benefit all of society 
Refrigerants used are to meet the requirements stipulated in the European F-gas Regula­
tion (EU/517/2014)  In refurbishments and new establishments, refrigeration systems are to be 
replaced by systems using natural refrigerants (CO2 or propane)  Efforts are under way in the 
Group to discontinue the use of refrigerants that have the greatest impact on the climate and 
to convert to cooling systems that only use natural refrigerants  The work is comprehensive 
and proceeding according to plan 
Axfood has had ambitious energy efficiency targets for several years, and has worked sys­
tematically for a long time to reduce its electricity consumption, work that has intensified in 
recent years  The Group’s electricity consumption is to decline 10% per square metre by 2025 
(compared with the base year 2020)  In 2022, this work was complemented with operational 
efficiency measures in order to further contribute to a reduction in consumption  Along with 
various investments, major and minor energy saving measures were implemented to help 
reduce consumption in the short and long term  Follow-up of energy use provides good docu­
mentation to further optimise as well as prevent and manage deviations  Since Axfood’s oper­
ations require substantial electricity for refrigeration, lighting and ventilation, the choice of 
purchased electricity and the efficient use of energy are important  Fuels, district cooling and 
district heating are also used to some extent in the warehouse operations  Many stores have 
heat recovery systems, reducing the need to purchase energy for heating  The Group also has 
stores and warehouses that sell surplus heat to the district heating network  
Fuel consumption from the Group’s own trucks is followed up quarterly  Consolidation of 
total fuel consumption is conducted centrally  Axfood has central power purchase agree­
ments that cover most of its units  Facility management staff have operational responsibility 
for following up and optimising the Group’s warehouse operations  Energy managers for each 
chain are involved in management and operations, and they are responsible for monitoring 
and following up the use of energy and refrigerants in stores  Energy consumption is moni­
tored, followed up and measured using a joint control system that is connected to the Group’s 
stores and warehouses  The system sounds an alarm if temperature zones deviate from the 
desired threshold levels  
To follow up the results of various energy efficiency initiatives, both energy consumption 
and energy intensity are measured  This facilitates follow-up and identifies whether a store or 
warehouse needs to be reviewed with respect to operation or investing in improvements 
Energy intensity is reported both quarterly and yearly, while total energy consumption is 
reported on a yearly basis  Outcomes of specific energy efficiency measures are followed 
up by an internal working group and on a quarterly basis by the Executive Committee  
Axfood devotes the most attention to Group-owned stores since this is where it has the great­
est opportunity to optimise energy consumption  
Green transports
Transports between warehouses and stores account for the largest portion of Axfood’s carbon 
footprint in own operations, and comprehensive work is therefore ongoing to minimise emis­
sions and environmental impact from logistics  Choosing sustainable fuels means constantly 
taking changing conditions into account  To diversify risks and opportunities, Axfood has cho­
sen to diversify the vehicle fleet and uses multiple types of trucks as well as fuels  This enables 
Axfood to contribute to new and innovative types of vehicles, the production of sustainable 
fuels and infrastructure that is driving the green transition  All Group-owned trucks can be 
driven on fossil-free fuels  At year-end 2023, Axfood owned 200 (180) heavy-duty trucks and 86 
(90) light trucks  Close collaboration with truck manufacturers and fuel retailers is helping to 
improve the efficiency of subcontracted transports as well  Axfood contributes indirectly to 
reducing the impact of procured transports through knowledge-sharing and by setting demands 
in procurement processes 
Axfood is working to increase the share of electric vehicles in order to further reduce the 
climate impact of transports  In 2021, Dagab’s first fully electric heavy-duty truck went into 
operation  The following year, the fleet was expanded with a 64-tonne electric truck and 
trailer, the first of its type in Sweden using smart technology for heavy refrigerated and frozen 
electrified food transports 
Reporting is performed in accordance with the so-called reduction obligation and sustain­
ability legislation  Data for Group-owned trucks is received monthly directly from the fuel sup­
pliers  Data for procured transports is received quarterly via the Swedish Association of Road 
Transport Companies’ software tool for reporting environmental and climate impact  In addi­
tion to replacing trucks in the Group’s own fleet with more sustainable vehicles, fuel consump­
tion is monitored to optimise loads and trips  With the help of transport optimisation systems, 
loads can efficiently be planned and routes are optimised  All trucks are equipped with a moni­
toring system that allows Axfood to actively employ eco-driving to reduce its carbon footprint 
through more efficient driving behaviours  Results from the various initiatives are followed up 
by measuring emissions in relation to the tonnes of goods delivered from warehouses to 
stores  This indicates how planning and optimisation of trips can impact emissions  Externally, 
the Group reports kg of CO2 equivalents in relation to the tonnes of goods delivered for 
Group-owned trucks on a quarterly and yearly basis  For procured transports, the outcome 
is reported externally on a full-year basis

The total CO2 effect per tonne of delivered goods for the Group’s own transports decreased 
significantly to 12 3 kilos CO2e (13 6)  This decrease was primarily attributable to more exten­
sive use of renewable fuels as a result of the continual conversion of the vehicle fleet  Use of 
fossil fuels in the fuel mix decreased and diesel use fell to 24% (29) in favour of a higher share 
of biodiesel and HVO

Energy intensity measured in relation to Group net sales decreased somewhat in 2023 and 
amounted to 3 5 (3 6)  Net sales increased substantially during the year  However, energy 
intensity decreased in relation to square metres, which is mainly attributable to large ware­
house spaces intended for automation in the Group’s new logistics centre in Bålsta not having 
been put into full use 
Sustainable materials
Being better at using the resources that are already in circulation is an important part of 
Axfood’s sustainability efforts  The Group is therefore working to increase efficiency in its use 
of resources, recyclability, and the use of renewable materials  Developing climate-smart 
packaging for the Group’s private label products in order to minimise environmental impact 
and avoid food waste is highly prioritised  The objective is to reduce the use of plastics and 
prioritise renewable and recycled material without hazardous chemical compounds

THE ENVIRONMENT
Packaging
Axfood employs various measures to ensure that its assortment of private label products are 
packaged as sustainably as possible  Packaging material is chosen based on the products’ 
needs and properties  Packaging should preserve and protect the food, be cost-effective and 
safe for the food it packages, and work practically in logistics, in stores and for consumers  
The amount of packaging material is minimised as far as possible without risking the quality 
of the contents or reducing the material’s recyclability 
Plastic is a common material with good properties that can extend the shelf life of prod­
ucts, which can help reduce food waste  Together with other members of the Swedish Food 
Retailers Federation, Axfood has set a packaging target for its private label products  More 
sustainable plastic packaging will be used, and the purchase of recycled material and the 
share of products that are designed for recycling will both increase  At the same time, Axfood 
will advocate for regulations and incentives that promote transition to circular material flows  
Axfood has adopted a plastics strategy to create the cleanest plastic flows possible in the 
long term by using the right plastic in the right place and enabling material recycling  The 
strategy encompasses five main areas: reducing the use of plastics; material recyclability; use 
of recovered or renewable ingredients; elimination of hazardous compounds (SIN – Substitute 
It Now) and increased use of FSC-certified paper (Forest Stewardship Council) for sustain­
able forestry  An action plan has been formulated in association with the plastics strategy 
that delineates how Axfood defines and sets boundaries for sustainability targets for the 
Group’s internal plastic flows and packaging for its private label products  The plan defines 
the targets, key ratios, scope and boundaries of the plastics strategy  It identifies where 
impacts arise and if the Group’s work encompasses the product’s primary, secondary or ter­
tiary packaging  In addition, a quality assurance system was also devised in which packaging 
data for all private label products is compiled  This compilation serves as the basis for a zero 
measurement surrounding the amount of material used  It is used to document which material 
is to be used and what changes should be made to achieve the targets  
Axfood is pursuing the duty to inform with regards to sales between companies, and has 
raised the issue of chemicals in packaging within the Swedish Food Retailers Federation, 
which now uses the SIN list as an essential tool in its packaging work  Phasing out the use of 
compounds on the SIN list in packaging is challenging since many suppliers have insufficient 
knowledge about added chemicals in packaging as well as which process chemicals are used  
For this reason, legislative support through a duty to inform about which chemicals are 
included in packaging of a product would facilitate setting requirements above and beyond 
the legal requirement
A few years ago, Axfood was the first food retailer in Sweden to introduce deposits for plas­
tic fruit drink and juice bottles in an effort to achieve greater circularity and thus a lower car­
bon footprint  The initiative has made a big impact in the industry and has opened up for bot­
tle deposits for similar products on the market

Total energy consumption amounted to 382,997 MWh (366,613) in 2023  The increase was 
mainly attributable to higher consumption as a result of more stores and warehouses  The 
use of non-renewable fuel continued to decline, the result of transitional efforts for transports 
between warehouses and stores  The amount of purchased electricity for stores also contin­
ued to decrease as a result of ongoing efforts to improve energy efficiency  Despite more 
electricity from the Group’s own solar panels, the total amount of self-generated energy 
declined due to renovation work on freezers, which resulted in less heat from refrigeration 
units  In total, 19 solar power facilities (17) were in operation at stores and warehouses during 
the year 
Axfood became the first company in the food retail industry to complete a database contain­
ing approximately 18,000 different packaging materials included in products, with the aim to 
accelerate the transition to recyclable packaging made from renewable or recycled material  
All of Axfood’s suppliers of private label products participated in the work of collecting and 
compiling information on the exact packaging components and material contained in each 
product  The database makes it possible to retrieve information on which products use the 
largest volumes of materials that need to be replaced 
Collaboration regarding the interpretation of upcoming EU packaging legislation intensi­
fied within the Swedish Food Retailers Federation packaging group in 2023  Several partner­
ships were also initiated with suppliers to jointly reduce the use of plastics in various products  
An industry-wide declaration of intent concerning packaging of frozen products has been 
adopted in order to increase recyclable packaging for private label products  During the year, 
several new forms of packaging were produced using better materials and with less print to 
make them better suited for recycling  Packaging with less plastic was used for a number of 
Axfood’s private label products  Other packaging has been replaced with plastic that has 
fewer chemicals or plastic without laminate to create a more circular system  
Waste
By sorting waste in offices, warehouses and stores, Axfood is working to reduce the share of 
waste sent off for incineration and increase the share sent to recycling  Recycling and waste 
handling procedures are based on Swedish legislation and employed at all stores and ware­
houses  High requirements for sorting primarily pertain to Group-owned stores  The work 
requires an in-depth understanding of the leases for individual stores, since they have differ­
ent conditions for sorting waste  Additional factors that make a difference include the dis­
tance of each store from biogas stations, and varying ability to dispose of packaging material 
Axfood has its own system support for waste handling, but also receives complementary 
reports from all waste handling contractors  The Group’s system includes more than 300 local 
agreements for Willys, Hemköp’s Group-owned stores, Snabbgross, Eurocash and Dagab  
Awareness and engagement with the issue are encouraged through training in sorting and 
regular follow-up of the share of waste sent off for incineration  The Group reports externally 
on the number of tonnes of waste and the share that is sent to recycling according to the dis­
posal method for Group-owned stores 
At the beginning of 2024, new statutory requirements entered into force based on the 
EU Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (PPWD)  Packaging must be separated from 
organic food waste, which has several advantages  When packaging is separated, it reduces 
the risk of residual plastic mixing with fertiliser produced from biogas digestate and being 
introduced into fields  More of the packaging material can also be recycled instead of inciner­
ated  In 2023, tests in a number of stores resulted in the development of a functional way of 
working with the new requirements for managing packaging waste  BUSINESS REVIEW

A portion of organic waste is incinerated in cases where biogas production is not an option 
The total amount of waste increased slightly in 2023 to 51,975 tonnes (51,424), mainly 
because the operations are growing  The recycling rate increased to 75 9% (75 0), driven by 
higher volumes of corrugated board, office paper and newspapers  During the year, Axfood 
also continued to work with waste handling collectors to adapt containers and collections to 
the current need and thereby reduce unnecessary transports  The new statutory requirement 
that municipalities must accept food waste from stores helped increase the share of organic 
material converted to biogas 
Sustainable farming
The largest share of the food retail sector’s environmental impact comes from primary pro­
duction, meaning agriculture  This includes, for example, carbon footprint, biodiversity, the use 
of pesticides and eutrophication  Axfood will improve the offering of sustainable products 
while imposing stricter requirements for the broad assortment  This includes working with 
­
different sustainability labelling, for example organic products 
Biodiversity
Biodiversity is a precondition for most food production – a large portion of food depends on 
pollination by insects like bees, bumble bees and butterflies  Axfood’s business depends on 
well-functioning ecosystems, and initiatives are being carried out to promote and support 
biodiversity  In 2023, a strategy was developed that summarises the Group’s impact on bio-
diversity and describes the overall work for preserving a rich diversity of plant and animal life 
There are recommendations for how to create green spaces when building new stores and 
warehouses to replace the loss of biodiversity  For example, plants can be placed around 
parking spaces and buildings, green roofs created and insect hotels installed  
The Group’s diversified vehicle and fuel policy ensures that no raw goods from palm oil are 
mixed in as a raw good in the fuel to avoid further clearance of the rainforest  For the same 
reason, only certified palm oil and soy are used in private label products  All coffee, tea, choc­
olate and cacao sold under private labels are sourced from growers with approved certifica­
tions from the Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade or KRAV  All bananas sold are to have sustainabil­
ity certification, such as Fairtrade, organic or Rainforest Alliance  In order to promote 
biodiversity in and around agriculture, farms that supply Axfood with fresh fruit and vegeta­
bles are certified according to IP Sigill or Global GAP 
According to the Group’s procedure, goods with a large water footprint are to have a rec­
ognised water standard by no later than 2025 in order to help maintain biodiversity in the agri­
cultural landscape  Axfood’s proposal for a sustainable food strategy for Sweden, the report 
Food 2030, includes suggestions such as expanded grazing and conversion of bulls to steer 
for increased grazing of natural grazing land with rich plant and animal life  The target to only 
sell fish and shellfish products that is ecolabelled or green-listed in the WWF’s fish guide con­
tributes to preserving biodiversity in oceans and lakes 
Axfood’s target of increasing the share of sales of organic and sustainability-labelled prod­
ucts impacts biodiversity and is an important incentive to pivot toward more sustainable food 
production and consumption  As a part of Axfood’s work to promote biodiversity and reduced 
deforestation from production of private label products, soy in feed is to be replaced with 
more sustainable crops  One example of this is quark made from milk from cows fed a soy-free 
diet, which was launched under the Garant brand 
In 2023, a risk analysis was carried out focused on how Axfood’s purchasing affects, and 
is affected by, biodiversity  The analysis also included carbon footprint and analysed the pur­
chasing of rice, tomatoes, milk and coffee  The results showed that various measures should be 
taken to ensure that purchases do not contribute to the global loss of species or environmental 
depletion  The risk analysis will lead to a number of improvement projects and measures to 
ensure that purchasing do not contribute to eradication of species and form of habitats  Organic
Axfood’s goal is for the share of organic products to amount to at least 10% of food sales 
by 2025 the latest  In recent years, the trend towards organic products has been in decline 
across the entire industry, and the share of sales for Axfood fell in 2023 to 4 6% (5 1)  However, 
that trend stabilised somewhat towards the end of the year  Fruits and vegetables accounted 
for the largest decrease, while the share of sales of organic meat and milk, however, increased 
slightly  Several new organic products were launched during the year and special sales 
campaigns for organic products were carried out both in stores and e-commerce  Internally, 
Axfood has trained key individuals in the importance of organic production and how the share 
of sales can be increased  Hemköp has the highest share of sales of organic products in the 
industry and launched double points on purchases of organic food for members of the Klubb 
Hemköp loyalty programme during the year

Risk ingredients
The environmental and social impact of different products varies, even within the same 
category  Axfood can therefore help impact the environment in a more sustainable direction 
by managing its assortment  
Axfood advocates responsible purchasing and is developing an assortment that offers 
customers a wide selection of organic and other sustainability-labelled products  The quality 
assurance work primarily covers products sold under its private labels, although many sustain­
ability requirements apply to branded products as well  This process is based on policies and 
governance documents, where various quality and sustainability requirements govern where 
products may be purchased from and the requirements for the suppliers  
The policy is that the entire offering of coffee, tea, chocolate and cacao sold under 
the Garant, Eldorado and Dazzley private labels must be sourced from growers that have 
approved certifications from the Rainforest Alliance or Fairtrade  Bananas included in 
the assortment of fresh fruits and vegetables are to carry sustainability certification from 
Fairtrade, KRAV, Rainforest Alliance or EU organic certification that is supplemented with 
a standard for social sustainability  In addition, palm oil must be certified according to the 
Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO)  Corresponding requirements apply also for soy – 
both in food products and for indirect use in animal feed  These ingredients are associated 
with a higher risk of human rights violations and a high environmental impact in the farming 
sector  Seafood and shellfish sold in stores may not be red-listed according to the WWF’s fish 
guide unless it is certified according MSC, ASC, KRAV or IP Sigill  Any exceptions or departures 
from the applicable policies and governance documents must be approved in accordance with 
an established routine

List of banned pesticides
Axfood has prepared a list of pesticides that are not accepted for use in agriculture  The com­
pounds on the list are banned in the EU, but permitted to some extent in the countries where 
the products are grown  Axfood’s policy is that suppliers of fruits and vegetables must comply 
with the list of banned pesticides  With certain exceptions, the list of banned pesticides has 
been adopted by large parts of the food retail industry through the Swedish Food Retailers 
Federation, which is responsible for updating the list  Uniform requirements from the industry 
facilitates suppliers’ sustainability efforts 
Management of water stress
The Group is pursuing the issues of water stress and access to fresh water as part of its 
efforts to reduce the environmental impact of food production  It is also pursuing preventive 
efforts through a dialogue with its suppliers, monitoring the water situation in vulnerable 
regions and training quality assurance staff, sustainability managers and buyers  This is 
intended to reduce the water footprint in production, water-related risks in the supply chain 
and negative impacts  Both the water footprint arising from particular products and the water 
situation where they are farmed are taken into consideration as part of this process  Fresh 
fruit and vegetables with a high risk of water stress require a water standard  Business will not 
be conducted with suppliers who do not provide a water standard unless they provide an 
action plan 
At present, the water routine encompasses suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables  The goal 
is that all relevant private label and fruit and vegetable suppliers with a large water footprint in 
a risk area will use a recognised water standard or the equivalent by 2025 at the latest 
In 2023, tests were carried out to investigate how water standards can also be used for other 
categories of private label products

The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a framework of 
recommendations intended to guide the process of identifying climate-related financial 
risks and opportunities  Likewise, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures 
(TNFD) is a framework for measuring and reporting risks, impacts and nature-related 
dependencies  Working in accordance with recommendations from both frameworks 
entails identifying and assessing consequences arising from climate change and bio-
diversity loss and how they affect Axfood  This is a long-term process performed primarily 
as part of strategy efforts and existing risk management  Axfood employs many of the 
recommendations and structures information to create additional transparency for 
investors and other stakeholders  Axfood intends to gradually implement the parts of 
the framework that are applicable and relevant to its operations 
Climate and biodiversity
Climate and biodiversity are closely related and affect each other  An integrated effort that 
includes both areas is therefore necessary to ensure that measures in relation to the climate 
also support biodiversity and vice versa  Climate change and loss of biodiversity are the 
most serious global challenges facing humanity, creating significant strains and risks for 
the planet  Reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Inter­
governmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IBPES) show 
that changes in the climate and biodiversity are already affecting food production worldwide 
through, for example, extreme weather, water shortages, threatened ecosystems, and loss of 
pollinators and other species 
Agriculture is clearly responsible for a significant part of the world’s total greenhouse gas 
emissions and is also the largest driver of biodiversity loss  In turn, climate change and loss 
of biodiversity have harsh consequences for agriculture and food production  Joint global 
efforts to reverse this trend are therefore critical to the amount of food that can be produced 
in the future and how it will be produced  This makes the climate and biodiversity two of the 
more critical risks facing Axfood, affecting operations to varying extents in both the short and 
long term 
Governance
The foundation of Axfood’s climate and biodiversity efforts is a sustainability programme 
designed to strengthen its business while contributing to the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) and Sweden’s Environmental Objectives at the same time  The sustainability 
programme is an important tool encompassing both the Group’s sustainability policy and mul­
tiple climate and biodiversity targets  Axfood’s sustainability efforts are an integral part of its 
business model and governance  The Executive Committee and Head of Sustainability are 
responsible for overall strategies, targets, actions and follow-up  The Executive Committee 
determines climate and biodiversity targets for the entire Group every year  The Board of 
Directors considers sustainability issues from a strategic perspective  The Executive Commit­
tee and the Board also consider climate and biodiversity risks that could impact the strategic 
objectives  The Board monitors the risk management framework and is provided with an 
annual mapping of material risks including climate and biodiversity risks  To increase knowl­
Integrated climate and biodiversity work
edge among Axfood’s employees, the climate and biodiversity are both included in mandatory 
training  Climate and biodiversity training is also held for the Group’s managers and certain 
functions and departments within the Group, with a focus on concrete initiatives to reach 
Axfood’s goals  
Strategy
Axfood’s vision is to be the leader in affordable, good and sustainable food  Sustainability is 
an integral part of the business and the Group’s strategic priorities  Priorities for sustainability 
efforts are set partly through a double materiality assessment carried out in 2023 in order 
to determine where the Group should concentrate its efforts  The assessment includes the cli­
mate as well as biodiversity as material matters  The Group aims to further integrate the cli­
mate issue and its work with biodiversity into its risk and decision-making processes in the 
future, to respond better to financial consequences 
Axfood wants to help limit the average increase in global temperatures to 1 5° Celsius in 
accordance with the Paris Agreement  The Group has a target to reduce the carbon footprint 
per kilo of food sold and to reach net zero emissions in its own operations by 2030 at the lat­
est  The net-zero target means that emissions need to be reduced by at least 85% compared 
with the base year 2020 and that the remaining emissions need to be climate compensated  
The Group has been increasing its efforts to reduce emissions in Scope 3  Axfood’s biodiver­
sity strategy entails limiting negative impacts on biodiversity, and promoting and supporting 
it in every part of the operations, by increasing sales of organic and other sustainability-
labelled goods  Axfood supports the UN’s goals outlined in the Kunming-Montreal Global 
Biodiversity Framework: stopping the loss of biodiversity by 2030 and achieving a recovery by 
2050  There are also ambitious requirements for procurement, with a focus on specific goods 
and geographic areas where the risk of a negative environmental impact and human rights 
violations is deemed to be significant in order to take additional steps  Reducing food waste 
by 50% is another important part of the strategy to reduce the negative impact on the climate 
as well as biodiversity 
Scenario
Measuring financial risks related to climate change and impact on biodiversity is complex  
The combined impacts of transition risks and physical risks should therefore be assessed 
based on multiple scenarios  Axfood has the ability to build resiliency and ward off the impact 
of such scenarios by increasing its diversification of risk and changing internal processes and 
procedures, which will also help work to adapt future strategies  On the other hand, it is likely 
that the Group, just like other companies in the industry and society as a whole, will feel the 
impact of higher costs for managing impacts and additional preventive measures  Axfood will 
continue to refine its scenarios based on the IPCC and IPBES reports and other research in 
support of its risk assessment process  Additional and more in-depth analyses are needed to 
be able to draw more decisive conclusions about financial risks and impacts 
Climate change and biodiversity loss may create wide-ranging impacts for Axfood and the 
entire food industry  In some parts of the world, such as the Mediterranean, it will become dif­
ficult to raise food to the same extent as today due to higher average temperatures, heat 
waves, rising sea levels and water shortages  Harvests are also expected to fluctuate signifi­
cantly from year to year due to extreme weather variations and factors such as diseases and 
pests  In other places such as in Sweden, higher temperatures will probably result in longer 
growing seasons and the ability to raise more crops  This may result in higher productivity for 
domestic food production  At the same time, uncertainty factors exist, such as irregular water 
access, pests and invasive species  Warmer average temperatures could eventually lead to a 
deterioration in living conditions for animals and plants  Pollinators are being threatened by 
chemicals and the lack of preserved natural spaces, resulting in food and habitat shortages  
The most valuable arable land is often close to coastal areas, lakes and other bodies of water  
More precipitation and higher water levels as a result of more extreme weather, higher tem­
peratures and melting ice and glaciers are tangible threats to these areas  In addition, marine 
heat waves may have devastating impacts on marine environments and ecosystems that sup­
ply the world with fish and shellfish today 
Risk management
To prevent risks or mitigate their effects and loss, Axfood employs an established risk man­
agement process whereby climate and other risks are continuously identified, managed and 
reported (see pages 28–32)  All of the risks identified are assessed on the basis of two equally 
important aspects: probability and impact  Climate risks have also been assessed on the basis 
of the Company’s impact, but also according to how the climate and climate change may 
affect Axfood’s ability to operate  The risks are multifaceted and encompass both transition 
risks that arise as a result of adapting to a more sustainable operation and the physical 
effects of climate change 
A risk analysis was carried out in 2023 to gain a better understanding of how a changed 
climate and biodiversity loss are affecting Axfood’s operations, strategies, prices and supply 
chains as well as how the Group’s purchases impact the climate and biodiversity  The LEAP 
(Locate, Evaluate, Assess, Prepare) concept, which is the integrated methodology that the 
TNFD has developed to guide biodiversity work, is used to identify and assess nature-related 
matters  A survey of sensitive areas related to Axfood’s operations has been initiated, evalu­
ating the Group’s dependence and impact on nature and assessing risks and opportunities 
related to the climate and biodiversity  With more than 70,000 items produced all over the 
world, excluding and prioritising were essential for focusing on material regions and goods 
with high risks and where Axfood’s influence is significant  The results of the analysis indicate 
that Axfood is significantly impacted, and will continue to be impacted, when the climate 
changes and ecosystems are compromised  Additionally, the complex impact of purchasing 
on the climate and biodiversity was made clear, along with how vulnerable products are to the 
effects of climate change and biodiversity loss  These effects could lead to reduced access to 
goods, higher purchasing prices and lower quality  The site-specific nature of biodiversity and 
the lack of robust data lead to additional complexity  The need for in-depth and continuous 
risk analyses was clarified, as was the need to include more precise descriptions of the risks 
associated with biodiversity loss in Axfood’s overall risk management

Transition risks
Transition risks are financial risks that may arise during the conversion to a more circular 
economy with less impact on the climate and biodiversity  More stringent environmental 
policies, new regulations, developments in technology and changing markets may affect 
Axfood’s operations and result in higher costs, for example for energy, materials and fuels 
in the short and long term 
In the short term, there is a risk of not responding to the trend toward more environmentally 
aware consumers and changes in shopping behaviour by adjusting the assortment  This could 
lead to lower sales and contribute to uncertainty on the part of investors and other stakehold­
ers concerning how the Group manages climate issues 
In the medium to longer term, more investments may be needed when replacing heating 
and refrigeration systems in stores and warehouses in order to make energy consumption 
more efficient and reduce the use of non-approved refrigerants  Higher energy costs for pur­
chased electricity, refrigeration and heating due to higher environmental taxes or a limited 
supply are also viewed as transition risks  Diversifying the Group’s vehicle fleet is expensive 
but strategically important in the transition to a climate-neutral economy  This process 
reduces the risk of higher costs as a result of rising diesel prices, taxes or limited supply  
More stringent environmental legislation, in the form of Sweden’s adoption of the Kunming-­
Montreal agreement and the European Green Deal, as well as higher expectations from con­
sumers and investors about sustainable goods production, will likely lead to increased costs 
Physical risks
Physical risks are associated with climate- and weather-related events such as drought, 
floods and storms  These events may have both direct financial consequences through 
roperty damage to stores and indirect consequences from lost or more expensive deliveries 
Increased precipitation and higher sea levels may result in flooding making stores unable to 
remain open, resulting in lower sales  A warmer climate may result in higher operating costs as 
the need for refrigeration in warehouses and stores increases  In the case of new establish­
ments, the necessity to locate the buildings to prevent the risk of flooding and ensure that 
equipment maintains the necessary energy performance is taken into account  Axfood 
believes that it is more expensive to compensate for these impacts afterwards than to pre­
vent damage  Extreme and challenging weather conditions as a result of global warming are 
an ever-increasing challenge for food production  It may become more difficult to obtain cer­
tain products, which may result in higher prices that affect sales  Diversifying risk requires a 
clearer distribution of risk across several geographic areas as early as during the purchasing 
process, work that is already being carried out in several product categories  Biodiversity loss 
will lead to increased occurrence of pests, reduced pollination and reduced soil fertility, which 
will lead to lower-quality, more sporadic harvests  This, in turn, will likely lead to a need for 
price hikes  Marine resources will also be negatively impacted and seafood costs will increase  
Ecosystems that are destroyed or damaged could also lead to reduced carbon capture by 
plants and soil, which would result in increased greenhouse gases that further accelerate 
­
climate change  Opportunities
Climate- and biodiversity-related risks may also constitute opportunities for Axfood  Pro-
active, decisive and preventive work related to climate and biodiversity can create new busi­
ness opportunities, support product development and attract new customers, investors and 
employees  Diversifying purchasing to more suppliers makes the operations less sensitive to 
individual price increases  Improved resource efficiency and other preventive measures in 
agriculture and aquaculture could lead to a reduced climate impact as well as a positive 
impact on biodiversity, while at the same time increasing production and thereby improving 
the economy, primarily in the production stage, thus leading to lower costs for Axfood 
Investments in the sustainability area often produce cost savings  By increasing the share 
of green electricity, emissions and costs decrease  Reducing the use of plastics, food waste 
and fuel consumption are examples of activities that benefit the climate and biodiversity as 
well as Axfood’s financial development 
Targets and key ratios
Axfood reports several key ratios for sustainability targets that meet identified risks  The 
climate and biodiversity targets help in various ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
from Axfood’s own operations and in the supply chain  Methods used to define and measure 
the targets are stated in the reporting principles (see pages 100–101)  
The climate target is achieving net zero emissions from own operations by 2030 at the 
­
latest  This means that emissions need to be at least 85% lower compared with the base year 
2020 and that remaining emissions need to be climate compensated  Axfood is to annually 
reduce the carbon footprint per kilo of food sold through changes in the sales mix, to reduce 
electricity consumption by 10% per square metre by 2025 (base year 2020), and to refrain 
from using refrigerants that affect the climate when investing in new refrigeration systems  
In addition, the share of domestic flights is to be reduced by 50% by 2025 (base year 2019)  
A compilation of the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 as well as parts of the Scope 3 emissions can be 
found on page 85  Emissions from the Group’s delivery fleet are to be reduced by at least 30% 
by 2025 (base year 2020), while plastic use is to be reduced by 25% by 2025 (base year 2019)  
Axfood’s goals for biodiversity are to increase the proportion of sustainability-labelled 
goods to at least 30% of retail sales and the proportion of organic food to at least 10% of food 
sales by 2025  There is also a goal to increase the share of sales of meat from natural grazing, 
or with KRAV or Svenskt Sigill labels, as well as to certify private label organic meat and char­
cuterie products according to KRAV  Selling fish and shellfish that are exclusively sustainabili­
ty-labelled or green-listed according to the WWF’s fish guide is an important goal for seafood  
The goal of reducing food waste by 50% by 2025 (base year 2015) is another sustainability 
goal that supports biodiversity as well as the climate  At least three projects to replace soy 
with sustainable food crops are also to be carried out by no later than 2025 in order to pro­
mote biodiversity and to reduce deforestation  Packaging for private label products is to be 
made from circular materials, such as renewable or recycled raw materials, by no later than 
2025  Axfood is to increase the use of FSC-labelled material in forestry goods  
In 2024, Axfood will develop procedures to manage forthcoming EU legislation such as the 
regulation on deforestation and CSRD

Health, gender equality, inclusion and working conditions are factors 
that affect people’s well-being  Axfood is responsible for ensuring that 
human rights are respected throughout the value chain and strives to 
promote good work environments and social conditions for its own 
employees as well as workers in food production  More consumption 
of healthy products is an important step toward improving consumer 
health  Axfood’s efforts in this area are reported under the focus areas 
sustainable suppliers, diversity enriches and healthy habits 
Sustainable suppliers
Food should be produced in the most sustainable way possible  A sound selection process 
allows Axfood to prioritise suppliers with strict requirements for safety, the environment and 
social responsibility while promoting good working conditions throughout the entire value 
chain  High transparency lends credibility to sustainability efforts  Axfood observes a Code 
of Conduct that is based on internationally recognised conventions on human rights, working 
conditions, the environment and anti-corruption 
Responsibility throughout the supply chain
Supply chains in the food retail industry are complex and often built upon multiple tiers with 
primary ingredients from several countries  Maintaining good supplier relationships and trans­
parency makes it easier to influence developments in a positive direction  The challenge is 
especially great in countries with insufficient official supervision and weak institutions and 
trade unions  Industries in countries generally not considered risk countries are scrutinised if 
they have a large share of foreign seasonal workers  Problems associated with risk sectors 
also exist in Sweden  Axfood therefore requires that all Swedish fruit and vegetable suppliers 
are certified according to IP Sigill Arbetsvillkor (“IP Sigill Working Conditions”) or an equiva­
lent  Sustainability assessments are carried out for wild berry and mushroom suppliers from 
Finland and Sweden to check that the suppliers systematically follow up on the requirements 
in Axfood’s Code of Conduct 
The supplier base for the private label assortment is made up of 447 (439) suppliers and 
1,328 (1,311) sub-suppliers  A total of 582 (465) suppliers and sub-suppliers in this group have 
production located in risk countries on Amfori BSCI’s list of risk countries, which is why pur­
chasing from these suppliers is followed up  As of 2022, Ukraine is not defined as a risk country 
to avoid placing unreasonable demands on Ukrainian suppliers while the war is ongoing  
All supplier agreements are negotiated centrally  By coordinating Axfood gains strong pur­
chasing power that contributes to greater knowledge and control throughout the entire value 
chain  Control is exercised through follow-up of the Code of Conduct, sustainability assess­
ments in connection with purchases of private label products and social site audits of suppli­
ers, primarily in risk countries  By gaining insight into suppliers’ operations at an early stage, 
Axfood has greater influence and a better opportunity to ensure compliance with standards  
This also creates an understanding of which suppliers Axfood needs to work more actively 
with in order to reduce the risk of deficiencies

Due diligence process for human rights and the environment
Axfood’s Code of Conduct follows the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights  
The purchasing process includes continually monitoring social and environmental risks and 
requiring that action be taken when needed  
Axfood requires its suppliers to demonstrate a systematic approach to complying with the 
Group’s Code of Conduct and responding to identified sustainability risks  For example, they 
may provide evidence of social site audits, collective bargaining agreements with union 
organisations or projects with relevant stakeholders  The Maplecroft risk database is used as 
a comparison to the suppliers’ own risk assessments  
Axfood played an influential role in the formation of the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) in 
Sweden, where industry works together with trade unions and voluntary organisations to 
improve environmental considerations and respect for human rights in global purchasing  
Axfood is represented on the ETI Sweden’s board and actively participates in its food and bev­
erage working group as well as the Swedish platform for high-risk crops  Within this working 
group, Axfood has led the initiative to carry out a human rights impact assessment (HRIA) for 
sesame seeds from Sudan, allowing all players to jointly prevent and address risks of viola­
tions  The work was temporarily suspended when armed conflict broke out in Sudan 
Axfood imposes requirements regarding access to readily available grievance mechanisms 
that allow for remediation, something that is often unavailable for seasonal migrant workers  
A project is therefore being carried out, together with ETI in the UK and leading English retail­
ers within fresh fruit and vegetables, to improve access to grievance mechanisms for migrant 
works in several supply chains in Spain and Italy 
Sustainability assessment in purchasing
The starting point for Axfood’s work with suppliers is its Code of Conduct, which lays out 
basic requirements for suppliers concerning the environment, human rights and animal wel­
fare  Every supplier who enters into an agreement with Axfood must sign the Code of Conduct 
or have its own with corresponding standards  The Code of Conduct is included in all supplier 
agreements, except for certain local suppliers which are handled directly by store managers  
Suppliers undertake to adhere to the Code of Conduct when they enter into a contract with 
Axfood, which the respective purchasing managers are responsible for  Existing supplier 
agreements are continually reviewed to ensure that all suppliers adhere to the requirements 
Sustainability is an integral part of the purchasing process in connection with procurement 
of private label products  Procurement is to be conducted on equal terms, and sustainability 
requirements are to be specified early in the purchasing process  The purchasing department 
compiles a plan every year for launching new products that looks at the countries of origin of 
the products or their constituent ingredients  A sustainability assessment is performed if a 
product or at least 5% of an ingredient or product comes from a risk country  
Existing and potential risks in the supply chain are identified based on a number of different 
parameters, such as human rights, environmental risks, child labour and discrimination  Infor­
mation about risks for various ingredients is regularly updated by Maplecroft’s analysts  Among 
other measures, suppliers must show that they have a systematic approach to complying with 
Axfood’s Code of Conduct  This is be done through social audit reports or by showing that a 
collective bargaining agreement has been entered into with a recognised trade union  A cru­
cial aspect of this assessment is that the suppliers show transparency and are able to provide 
an account of potential environmental and social risks  Suppliers must also demonstrate how 
they respond to and minimise existing risks  Sustainability officers compare their answers 
with the information in the risk analyses and determine on a three-degree scale whether a 
supplier can be accepted, can be accepted under certain conditions or is disqualified from 
continuing with the procurement process

A supplier or sub-supplier is eliminated due to these assessments in nearly every procurement, 
and only approved suppliers are allowed to continue on to price negotiations  Axfood thus 
rewards suppliers who pursue thorough sustainability efforts in their supply chains while 
protecting them against unfair competition from suppliers who avoid responsibility  This 
procedure has been employed for several years and major improvements have been seen in 
categories such as frozen prepared foods, rice, tuna and legumes  More suppliers are mapping 
their supply chains down to the farming level and carrying out social audits and risk analyses 
Review of suppliers of private label products
Axfood has the greatest insight into and opportunity to influence private label product suppli­
ers  Strict requirements are imposed on these suppliers to minimise identified environmental 
and social risks  Social risks are associated above all with working conditions, corruption and 
human rights  These risks are judged to be the greatest in farming, product manufacturing and 
the non-food product category  Environment-related risks in the supply chain involve, for 
example, control of hazardous compounds in production, pesticides in agriculture, use of 
water and waste handling  All suppliers have different prospects for minimising and prevent­
ing risks in their operations and along their own sub-supply chains  The solution to deviations 
is not to discontinue the business relationship as the first choice, but rather to demand 
improvements and ensure that they are implemented  However, Axfood discontinues the busi­
ness relationship if the supplier does not take the actions required, does not show a willing­
ness to improve or in cases of corruption or false information  Axfood strives for suppliers’ 
operations to be more sustainable, and efforts are being made within development and infor­
mation projects to disseminate knowledge among workers in the supply chain  Axfood stands 
behind the principle of everyone’s right to a wage that they can live on  The legal minimum 
wage that exists in many countries does not always cover the basic costs for a family – in 
other words, it is not always a living wage  Axfood has a living wage strategy that guides its 
efforts to improve living conditions in the supply chain  
Improvements in the supply chain
Axfood participates in several international projects to help improve the supplier chain  In col­
laboration with Oxfam, value chains for a number of product ingredients were analysed to 
identify ways of helping growers and farmers achieve a sustainable living  For several years, 
Axfood participated in a project in the basmati rice region in Punjab, Pakistan that has helped 
certify Garant’s jasmine and basmati rice in accordance with the Sustainable Rice Platform 
(SRP) or Fairtrade  This means that all jasmine and basmati rice from Garant now is either 
organic and or certified with Fairtrade or the SRP 
In 2023, Axfood introduced a living wage procedure in procurements with top priority 
assigned to social sustainability  The procedure entails improving existing sustainability 
assessments by including questions about living wages in the supply chain for single-ingredient 
products from Peru, India and Morocco  This benefits suppliers who make the most effort to 
raise wages for farm and factory employees, thereby gradually taking important steps towards 
achieving the goal of living wages in prioritised supply chains by 2030  During the year, it was 
revealed that the wages in a supply chain for coconut milk in Sri Lanka were under the UN’s 
poverty line  Starting in 2024, Garant’s organic coconut milk will be Fairtrade certified 
In addition to assessments in connection with new private label procurements, annual 
assessments are conducted in which existing suppliers are evaluated  The aim is to actively 
cooperate with existing suppliers, follow up any action plans and support sustainability 
efforts  Efforts are followed up on a continuous basis and evaluated after the period for mak­
ing improvements has expired  The supply chain and sub-suppliers operating in risk countries 
are identified  In 2023, supplier visits focused on sustainability were carried out to follow up 
on working conditions and environmental aspects related to farming of fruits and vegetables 
in Morocco and Ecuador, cashew nuts in Vietnam and frozen ready meals from Thailand 
For several years, Axfood has raised the issue of indentured berry pickers from Thailand 
who are forced to pay for their travel and other costs out of their own pockets  In 2023, Axfood 
began looking at the requirements for introducing the Employer Pay Principle (EPP), guidelines 
for employers entailing that they take greater responsibility for funding various social and 
economic benefits  An initiative was also introduced to have ETI coordinators gradually intro­
duce the EPP into the industry  Axfood has also joined an ETI project to improve labour condi­
tions within cashew farming and industry in Vietnam

Climate work in the supply chain
In 2023, a risk analysis carried out focused on how Axfood’s purchasing affects, and is 
affected by, biodiversity loss and a changing climate  The analysis focused on the selected 
goods rice, fresh tomatoes, milk and coffee  The results showed that going forward Axfood 
needs to introduce measures to address risks related to climate change and biodiversity loss  
The Climate Education Tool, launched in 2022, was revised and refined during the year, and 
translated into Mandarin  The tool, which was developed together with companies within the 
Axel Johnson Group and with the support of Axfoundation, is intended to make suppliers’ 
work easier when it comes to planning and reducing carbon emissions in their own operations 
and to provide concrete advice about how to address emissions in the entire value chain  The 
Climate Education Tool includes training modules and guidance for how companies can sur­
vey their emissions and formulate and follow up on climate goals 
During the year, a survey of climate goals and agendas among suppliers of private label 
products was carried out  The results showed that over half of suppliers have emissions goals 
for their own operations and that many also have goals aimed at net zero emissions before 
2030  Most suppliers have initiated climate-related work, with a focus on climate calculations 
and on formulating strategies and goals  Follow-up and dialogues have been started with a 
focus on suppliers that have not yet set any emissions goals 
Axfood has participated in the WWF’s Sustainable Food Supply Chain Corporate Partner­
ship for several years, together with 14 other Swedish food retail companies  A shared road­
map for a more sustainable food supply chain has been created to address the climate, biodi­
versity, resource efficiency, animal welfare and human rights 
Social audits
The risk of deviations from Axfood’s Code of Conduct is believed to be greatest if products 
are manufactured in or contain ingredients or material from risk countries  The Group employs 
the organisation Amfori BSCI’s classification of risk countries  In addition, there are risk sec­
tors in countries that are not traditionally regarded as risk countries  Axfood’s suppliers and 
sub-suppliers of private label products operate in approximately 40 such countries  Axfood 
requires social audits in all risk countries to ensure compliance with the requirements laid out 
in the Code of Conduct 
Amfori BSCI performs many of Axfood’s social audits, but audits according to the SEDEX 
and SA8000 standards, for example, are accepted as well  The audits by Amfori BSCI are bro­
ken down into five levels on a scale from A to E, where D and lower requires suppliers to submit 
an action plan and explain the main reasons for any deviations  Suppliers that are audited via 
Amfori BSCI are followed up through an established procedure within the framework of the 
audit system  Action plans are required and follow-up audits are conducted as needed  All 
action plans and follow-up audits are conducted, depending on the score, within 12 months to 
ensure that adequate measures have been completed  There is a zero tolerance policy for par­
ticularly urgent cases of serious human rights violations, such as child labour and compulsory 
labour, or where there is an immediate danger to health and safety  Serious deviations are fol­
lowed up directly with the supplier in accordance with an established process  In these cases, 
Amfori BSCI convenes immediate meetings with the supplier and buyers involved to agree 
upon an action plan  Social impact in the supply chain

1) The assessment was according to the SA8000 standard 
During the year, Amfori BSCI conducted a total of 88 (93) social audits of private label suppli­
ers and sub-suppliers, slightly fewer than in the preceding year  However, a total of 433 (363) 
suppliers in risk countries are subject to various types of social audits and sustainability stan­
dards  In total, 5 (4) suppliers were identified as having some sort of deviation from the Amfori 
BSCI audit system  Most deviations refer to health and safety violations combined with exces­
sive working hours and inadequate management to meet the requirements of the Code of 
Conduct  These violations have been followed up in accordance with the current procedure 
for establishing action plans  In one case, Axfood chose to terminate a business relationship 
because the supplier could not ensure acceptable follow-up of the Code of Conduct  Suppliers – anti-corruption and bribery
Through its Code of Conduct, Axfood requires contract suppliers to take active steps to pre­
vent corrupt conduct  Local suppliers that are dealt with directly by store managers are not 
included  When suppliers agree to the Code, they pledge that they have an anti-corruption 
policy and procedures to monitor corruption and unethical behaviour  The above requirement 
also applies to sub-suppliers  Axfood’s Code of Conduct stipulates zero tolerance for the pre­
sentation of false verbal or written information and the offer or acceptance of bribes or cor­
ruption  If a supplier violates any of these terms and does not rectify the shortcomings within 
the agreed time, this is sufficient to terminate the relationship  Monitoring of corruption risk in 
the supply chain is conducted in the case of suppliers of private label products that are made 
in risk countries, where the risk of corruption is considered to be greatest  Monitoring is car­
ried out through social audits and dialogue with suppliers  In some cases, this work is made 
more difficult since it is hard to gain insight into the sub-supplier level, especially finding out 
whether sub-suppliers have engaged in corrupt conduct  Sustainability officers follow up on 
social audits, and Amfori BSCI also conducts extensive integrity work including unannounced 
spot checks and reviews audits to identify any irregularities in audit documentation  Axfood 
has training on corruption issues in the supply chain for all employees in purchasing and qual­
ity assurance functions  The aim is to improve and develop internal processes in order to be 
able to combat corruption preventively in the supply chain

PEOPLE
Diversity enriches
Axfood is a values-governed and inclusive company that strives for an even gender break­
down and broad international representation among its employees  The employees’ diversity 
of talents, competencies, backgrounds and perspectives creates new opportunities, leads to 
better decisions and makes a positive contribution to the business  
Diversity and inclusion
Axfood endeavours to reflect the diversity of customers and offer all of its employees fair 
opportunities to contribute and grow professionally  Axfood aims to be an inclusive employer 
where everyone is treated with respect and where skills and potential are valued above demo­
graphic, cultural and socioeconomic differences  All workplaces are to be free from all forms 
of discrimination and offensive treatment 
Axfood has guidelines and governance documents that stress the importance of employ­
ees’ varying talents, competencies, backgrounds and perspectives, such as ethical conduct 
rules and an equal treatment policy 
Axfood works to increase diversity among its employees by ensuring objective and fair 
recruitment processes  Ambitious long-term targets ensure that the Company is moving 
toward a more even balance between men and women in management positions  Succession 
planning is one way of securing and retaining competence, diversity and equal opportunity 
within the organisation  This work is driven through transparency and continuous follow-up of 
target achievement 
One measure of gender equality is the share of women in management positions, and this is 
monitored internally for the individual companies on a monthly basis and communicated 
externally in interim reports and in the Annual and Sustainability Report  The share of women 
in leadership training courses is also reviewed

background, meaning individuals who were either born outside Sweden or whose parents 
were both born outside Sweden  In 2023, this share amounted to 18% (17)  
Business ethics and discrimination
To maintain a high level of trust among customers, suppliers and other stakeholders, it is 
important to uphold and strive for transparency and good business ethics  All individuals who 
perform work for Axfood or who in some other way represent the Group are – in addition to 
acting in accordance with applicable regulations and laws – obligated to adhere to the 
Group’s ethical conduct rules and equal treatment policy  Contract suppliers are required to 
certify that they accept Axfood’s Code of Conduct  In addition, to ensure adherence to the 
ethical guidelines and Code of Conduct, all employees with an authorisation right, or who can 
in some other way influence purchasing decisions for products or services, are required to 
sign the ethical conduct rules when they are hired and then every year thereafter 
Axfood’s whistleblower service contributes to compliance with the Code  It is a key tool for 
upholding sound corporate governance and contributing to an effective process in which risks 
and deficiencies in the operations are identified, so that they can be investigated and reme­
died  The whistleblower service, which covers all companies in Axfood, consists of one Group-
wide reporting channel and several company-specific reporting channels  The whistleblower 
chooses the appropriate channel to use  This technical solution is provided by an external con­
tractor, which enables anonymous reporting  Reported cases are initially addressed by 
a law firm  The number of cases reported and handled is reported to the Board annually 
The cases reported via the whistleblower function in 2023 were addressed in accordance 
with the established guidelines and procedures  11 (3) of the cases reported qualified as whis­
tleblower cases and were addressed and concluded  The cases that did not qualify as whis­
tleblower cases were either handed over to the relevant function at the company in question 
to be addressed, usually by the responsible HR manager, or the reporting party was encour­
aged to make similar contact themselves 
Healthy habits 
Ill-health is a major societal problem, where eating habits, lifestyle and work environment are 
common contributors  Axfood will work to support a healthier Sweden by offering its employ­
ees a healthy work environment with good working conditions that contribute to a low rate 
of sickness-related absence  Through quality assurance work, Axfood ensures and offers a 
varied assortment of healthy products that encourage good food habits and good health 
Work environment and employee health
Axfood is developing at a rapid rate, and increased complexity is placing new demands on 
Axfood’s employees  It is also becoming increasingly important to attract, develop and retain 
the right competence  Employees are to be offered a safe and healthy work environment 
which, together with good working conditions, creates a sustainable work climate with low 
sickness-related absence and good health  
Governance and work approach
Work environment and health are addressed in Axfood’s Code of Conduct, and a Group-wide 
work environment policy covers all companies and employees  Work environment and health 
initiatives are included as a natural part of the operations and are conducted through cooper­
ation between employers, employees and the employee unions  Managers, employees and the 
unions are to actively participate in the effort to achieve a good work environment that pro­
motes employees’ health  Axfood has a central HR organisation and local HR departments in 
the Group’s companies  At the central level, HR specialists work with Group-wide processes, 
systems and training  This work is supported by an employee manual, a work environment 
committee and employee support  The Group works both closely with operations and strate­
gically on issues pertaining to employees and their development  
Axfood has a Group-wide training unit for skills development, Axfood Academy  All employ­
ees have both the opportunity and an obligation to pursue continuing education and skills 
development  Employees receive relevant training for their roles and participate in perfor­
mance reviews with their immediate supervisors at least once a year  Together they draw up, 
decide on and follow up every employee’s development plan  Leaders take leadership courses, 
where they receive training in matters such as Axfood’s core values and leadership model, 
sickness-related absence, rehabilitation, recruitment and the work environment  They are also 
provided with tools to be able to act on early signs of ill-health and strive to decrease the sick­
ness-related absence rate through proactive wellness initiatives  
Axfood acts in accordance with labour and work environment laws as well as with collec­
tive bargaining agreements  Axfood believes that its governance of strategic employee mat­
ters is appropriate  All employees are employed by companies in the Group and are thus cov­
ered by collective bargaining agreements  Parts of operations are conducted by contractors 
or consultants, and for these individuals, work environment laws and regulations that apply for 
the respective workplaces are followed 
Monitoring
Axfood has high demands for a good working environment  Trends in incidents, injuries, 
employee turnover and the sickness-related absence rate are monitored closely, which is a 
way of evaluating the effectiveness of the continuing work with employee health and the work 
environment 
Employee turnover and the sickness-related absence rate are monitored internally at the 
Group and company levels on a monthly basis and are communicated externally on a quarterly 
and yearly basis  Key ratios are also monitored per contract area  Significant deviations from 
previous periods may be an indication of shortcomings in the operations and dissatisfaction 
among employees  The earlier these are detected, the greater the potential there is to influ­
ence, investigate and remedy  
Work environment initiatives within Axfood are governed, conducted and monitored 
through work environment committees  At the Group level, there is a work environment group 
made up of union representatives, a chief occupational safety officer, representatives from 
Axfood’s companies and Axfood’s central work environment function  At the company level, 
work environment committees are normally established at three different levels: central,

regional and local  The local safety committees cover operations in warehouses and stores  
At smaller workplaces without their own local safety committee, work environment activities 
take the form of safety inspections and employee meetings  This means that also employees 
at these workplaces have an influence over their work environment activities  
Axfood has system support and procedures to identify early signs of ill-health  Managers 
conduct well-being talks with employees in cases of repeated sickness-related absence  Talks 
are aimed at deciding together on measures for preventing ill-health and sick leave  
To ensure that managers have knowledge about procedures, training in systematic work 
environment initiatives, sickness-related absence, the rehabilitation process, and organisa­
tional and social work environments is mandatory

The rate of sickness-related absence in 2023 was the lowest since 2019 and totalled 6 4% 
(7 0)  Absence declined as the effects of the pandemic subsided  Axfood’s target is for sick­
ness-related absence not to exceed 5 3% 
Product safety
All of Axfood’s products are to comply with legislative requirements for health and food 
safety  If serious deficiencies in food safety, hygiene, the cold chain or product liability are 
identified for a specific product that risks customers’ health and safety, the product is recalled 
immediately 
Deficiencies related to product safety could cause financial loss as well as harm to the 
brand  Axfood therefore works actively in this area, through measures including extensive 
internal inspection programmes in stores and quality assurance of private label products  
Work encompasses the entire process, from recipe formulation and choice of additives to 
manufacturing  Relevant requirements are stated in the quality and sustainability strategy, 
which serves as an internal governance document and guidance on matters pertaining to 
product and food safety as well as other important requirements for product and production 
quality  The strategy stipulates specific requirements for the respective product categories  
Information on ingredients and composition is reviewed with respect to both internal policies 
and applicable laws  Only products that fulfil all internal and external criteria may be sold  This 
ensures that products sold in Axfood’s stores are safe for consumption and that information 
on constituent ingredients is accurate  
Compliance with and follow-up of the quality and sustainability strategy are integral parts 
of daily operations  Axfood has a policy that food suppliers must be certified according to a 
standard approved by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI)  For Axfood’s household chemi­
cal products, cosmetics, skin care products and non-food products, the suppliers must be 
certified according to ISO 9001  The quality and sustainability strategy is updated annually 
as existing requirements are expanded or new ones are implemented  Dagab’s quality and 
sustainability department is responsible for ensuring that both existing and new products 
meet requirements  In stores and warehouses, daily arrival and temperature checks are 
conducted, and clear procedures are in place for handling, for example, unpackaged foods 
to ensure that food hygiene is maintained and to uphold the integrity of the cold chain

Product recalls
Despite Axfood’s quality work and internal inspection programme, products are sometimes 
recalled  This happens when a product is deemed to pose a health risk or due to incorrect 
labelling or a quality defect  Clear internal procedures and action plans are in place for prod­
uct recalls, and serious recalls are communicated to the public via press release

branded products  Listeria and salmonella in eggs was one of the reasons for the increase in 
recalls  13 (5) recalls of private label products were of a serious nature  No recalls resulted in 
the imposition of fines 
Healthy choices
Axfood offers a varied assortment of healthy products that encourage good food habits  Both 
existing and new products in the assortment are continuously reviewed from a health per­
spective with the goal of minimising ingredients with negative health effects  The basic rule is 
not to use unnecessary additives, and additives such as for example azo dyes are never used  
Any additives used must fulfil key functions 
Long term work is ongoing to reduce the amount of salt and sugar in private label products 
without affecting the taste  Goods that consumers do not expect to contain sugar are priori­
tised  A proposal to introduce mandatory thresholds for sugar and salt in some foods, and for 
Sweden to accept financial support from an EU programme to promote fruits and vegetables 
at school, was introduced in the annual Food 2030 report, Axfood’s proposals for a sustain­
able food strategy 
In 2023, several new private label products with a health profile were launched, such as 
grilled frozen vegetables, salad meals, smoothies, dried banana snacks, ginger and turmeric 
shots, and Keyhole-labelled mince (Nöt & Grönt) with equal parts vegetables and beef 
Axfood will contribute to a healthier Sweden by encouraging its customers and employees 
to live a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle  Better public health and good food habits for 
everyone can be promoted by increasing knowledge and facilitating healthy choices among 
consumers  Axfood has initiated a long-term partnership with Generation Pep to ensure that 
children and young people have the right and the opportunity to live an active, healthy life  The 
organisations will work together to spread information about making healthier choices, and 
facilitate and conduct activities that encourage children and young people in this area

Reporting principles and definitions
Boundaries
Axfood’s sustainability report mainly covers the parts of the operations that have a significant 
and direct impact from a sustainability perspective – primarily the Group’s own operations  
Information that includes the independent retailers is presented when it is significant for pro­
viding a comprehensive picture of the Group’s sustainability efforts  Activities that are out­
side the Group’s direct control, such as the operations of suppliers of branded products, as 
well as customers’ activities are not included in the report unless stated otherwise 
Significant changes in the scope and boundaries of the reporting – Reporting of indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food sales (carbon dioxide 
equivalents, CO2e) have been added during the year  – During the year, the key performance indicator for the share of women in management 
positions was redefined to also include team managers  Comparison figures for 2022 
have been restated, which results in an increase in the key ratio outcome of approximately 
15 percentage points (35 percent to 51 percent for 2022)  – The key performance indicator for the share of sales of sustainability-labelled fish and 
shellfish has been redefined and is now reported in volume (kilos) instead of in SEK  This 
leads to better follow-up of actual consumption  Comparison figures have been restated  – Emissions from company cars in 2022 has been restated due to access to more accurate 
activity data  The value thus increases from 357 to 392 tonnes of CO2 equivalents  – Emissions from purchased supplementary heat from 27 of stores in Willys and 17 of stores 
in Snabbgross are included from 2023  Emissions from purchased heat (Scope 2) thus 
increased from 273 to 467 tons of CO2 equivalents, and emissions associated with fuel pro­
duction of purchased heat (Scope 3) increased from 30 to 53 tonnes of CO2 equivalents  
Comparison figures have been restated 
Emissions and climate impact
Data is collected internally and from relevant suppliers  Climate data is generally associated 
with a certain level of uncertainty owing to varying measurement methods and data quality  
A GHG emissions disclosure is also prepared within the framework of the Haga Initiative cor­
porate climate action network  Total greenhouse gas emissions is reported in tonnes of carbon 
dioxide equivalents (CO2e)  Recalculation to CO2e consists of mainly carbon dioxide, meth­
ane and nitrous oxide as well as f-gases  Reporting is in line the GHG protocol, with Axfood 
applying operational control as its consolidation method  This means that emissions are 
­
broken down according to who generates them in the use of resources  Specific emissions 
­
factors have been used to calculate Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions in accordance with the market-­
based method  For calculations of Scope 2 emissions in accordance with the ­
location-based 
method, the Nordic average mix for the full-year 2022 has been used: 90 4 g CO2/kWh  As a 
comparison, the Nordic average mix for 2021 was 90 4 g CO2/kWh  In 2023, Axfood initiated 
a screening and review of the Group’s direct and indirect emissions with the assistance of 
external consultants in order to quality-assure its existing climate calculations and map out 
and measure emissions in various stages of the value chain  A complete report on the results 
of the review will be published in the Annual and Sustainability Report 2024 
Emissions and climate impact from food sales
Reported in absolute numbers and according to the intensity measurement average 
CO2 equivalents per kilo of food sold  These calculations include land use and emissions 
factors taken from the RISE food climate database  The calculations exclude changes in 
land use, non-food items, packaging, and other goods and services  The selection includes 
Group-owned stores for Willys, Eurocash, Hemköp and Snabbgross 
Energy consumption
Reported in megawatt hours (MWh) and includes electricity consumption, heating and 
cooling  Calculations include only offices, warehouses and stores for which Axfood is the 
lease holder, except for three warehouses where certain data is provided directly by the les­
sor  Stores where district heating is part of the rental cost are not included  Purchased supple­
mental heat is included for five warehouses, 27 of Willys' stores and 15 of Snabbgross' stores  
In 2023, one of Snabbgross' stores had measurement errors which meant that these were 
excluded  Newly established stores and warehouses are included in reporting starting from 
the opening month  The selection includes electricity consumption under joint contracts for 
a total of 303 of Axfood’s Group-owned stores, three office buildings and ten warehouses  
Retailer-owned stores are not included  Self-generated energy pertains to solar power from 19 
of the Group’s own solar panel systems and self-produced heat from refrigeration units at four 
warehouses  Data pertains to consumption during the 2023 calendar year 
Energy intensity
Electricity consumption (MWh) under joint agreements as a percentage of Axfood’s net sales 
(SEK m)  The data presented pertains to actual consumption during the 2023 calendar year 
Electricity consumption in stores and warehouses
Electricity consumption is reported as the number of kilowatt hours (kWh) of purchased 
electricity used per square metre  The number of square metres corresponds to the total 
area of all stores and warehouses under the centralised agreement  All data pertains to 
consumption during the 2023 calendar year 
Refrigerants
Includes refills of refrigerants in all warehouses and stores, and refrigeration units in trucks  
The data is based on statutory refrigerant reports  Information on refrigerants in warehouses 
and stores pertains to the preceding year’s consumption  For carbon dioxide emissions, the 
Global Warming Potential (GWP) for the respective types of refrigerants has been calculated 
using emissions factors from the IPCC (2006) 
Transports
Primarily pertains to transports between warehouses and stores, but also e-commerce 
Group-owned transports
Reported data is based on consumption from 200 (180) heavy-duty trucks and 86 (90) light 
trucks  Data is collected from fuel suppliers  Emissions factors are compiled with the aid of 
documentation from the Swedish Energy Agency and fuel producers  Reported data for 
Group-owned transports is presented for the period December 2022–November 2023  
Emissions have been calculated in accordance with the so-called reduction obligation  
The volume of emissions (kilos) per tonne of delivered goods is based on purchased fuel (litres) 
in relation to total transported goods (tonnes) between warehouses and stores  Data pertains 
only to goods delivered using the Group’s own fleet 
Procured transports
For procured transports, reported data is based on 374 (317) trucks  Data on fuel consumption 
and emissions has been obtained from the Swedish Association for Road Transport 
Companies  Data for procured transports is presented for October 2022–September 2023  
Emissions have been calculated in accordance with the so-called reduction obligation

101 AXFOOD ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
The purpose of the EU Taxonomy (EU 2020/852) is to make it easier to identify and compare 
environmentally sustainable investments through a common classification system  Large 
undertakings which are public-interest entities affected by the sustainability reporting 
requirements of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive must report the proportion of their 
economic activities that is Taxonomy-eligible  
The Taxonomy is based on economic activities that research shows are responsible for a 
large share of GHG emissions, and that the EU deems to have a critical role to play in the tran­
sition to a climate-neutral, climate-resilient and more resource-efficient economy  Axfood’s 
food retail business is not one of the above referenced activities, so only a limited proportion 
of the company’s economic activities is Taxonomy-eligible  Although Axfood’s main activities 
are not Taxonomy-eligible, the Group is still considered able to contribute to the transition  
Axfood has engaged in thorough sustainability efforts, with sustainability as an integral part 
of the business, for many years  Even if the Group’s sustainability targets are not currently 
Taxonomy-eligible, several of them reflect the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  
Only a very limited proportion of Axfood’s turnover qualifies as direct revenue-generating 
activities according to the Taxonomy  However the Group has an indirect impact on the eco­
nomic activities mentioned in the Taxonomy on climate change mitigation and adaptation  
The Group’s investments in property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets as well as 
related costs are the main parts of the activities that are Taxonomy-eligible  Axfood’s Taxon­
omy-eligible activities, which may be environmentally sustainable now or in the future, are 
disclosed here together with the relevant reporting policies 
During the reporting year, new appendixes for the remaining four environmental objectives 
have been published, which means that additional economic activities may become relevant 
for reporting under the Taxonomy  Companies must report on alignment with these four envi­
ronmental objectives from 1 January 2024  One such potential activity that has been identi­
fied for Axfood is the production of plastic packaging for the Group’s private label products  
Since Axfood uses external suppliers for the production of plastic packaging, an assessment 
needed to be carried out to determine the degree of responsibility and control that Axfood is 
assumed to have in order to be required to report this activity under the Taxonomy  However, 
the Group was not deemed to have a sufficiently high level of control over the production pro­
cesses to conduct such an assessment since Axfood does not own raw materials or packaging 
but rather buys finished products directly from suppliers  Axfood’s reporting in accordance with the EU Taxonomy Regulation
Assessment of Taxonomy-eligible activities
Freight transport services by road
Axfood conducts economic activities in category 6 6 Freight transport services by road that 
qualify as contributing substantially to the environmental objective Climate change mitiga­
tion with respect to turnover from e-commerce, capital expenditures for own trucks and 
operating expenses for maintenance and repairs of own trucks 
Approximately 0 1% of Axfood’s retail sales corresponds to invoiced shipments for the 
e-commerce deliveries shipped by own trucks  Axfood is becoming increasingly dependent 
on transports with the growth of e-commerce  The Group’s own fleet is being converted to 
reduce carbon emissions by using more renewable fuels and becoming more fuel-efficient 
Dagab is responsible for the Group’s logistics flow  Products from suppliers are distributed 
from the store warehouses to stores belonging both to the Group and to external customers  
Separate e-commerce warehouses handle home deliveries in the Stockholm and Gothenburg 
areas  Home deliveries from the Group’s e-commerce warehouses are primarily distributed 
using own trucks, while store-to-home deliveries are made using a service provider 
Taxonomy-eligible capital expenditures pertains to Group-owned trucks, which have a 
clear connection to the core business 
A complete assessment of Taxonomy-aligned economic activities has not yet been con­
cluded  Axfood is dependent on third parties and has not received complete information 
regarding whether the vehicles qualify as not doing significant harm to the other environmen­
tal objectives in the Taxonomy  While it was not possible to determine whether the economic 
activity qualifies as Taxonomy-aligned, adjustments have been made to the purchasing terms 
to ensure that, going forward, the Group chooses tire classes that are Taxonomy-eligible 
Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles 
Axfood conducts economic activities in category 6 5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger 
cars and light commercial vehicles that qualify as contributing substantially to the environ­
mental objective Climate change mitigation with respect to purchases of Taxonomy-eligible 
goods and services  More specifically, this relates to capital expenditures for leases of passenger 
cars and company cars  Axfood is dependent on data from third parties to confirm whether these 
activities are ­
Taxonomy-aligned and began conducting assessments during the year by 
­
gathering the necessary information from its lessors  However, the Group has not received 
complete information regarding whether the vehicles qualify as not doing significant harm 
to the other environmental objectives in the Taxonomy  Acquisition and ownership of buildings 
Axfood conducts economic activities in category 7 7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings 
that qualify as contributing substantially to the environmental objective Climate change miti­
gation with respect to purchases of Taxonomy-eligible goods and services  More specifically, 
this relates to capital expenditures for new and renegotiated leases for premises that house 
stores and warehouses 
Axfood began conducting assessments during the year by gathering the necessary infor­
mation from property owners in order to confirm whether these activities are Taxonomy-­
aligned  To evaluate significant contribution to the climate goal, it was assessed whether the 
properties in question have a valid energy declaration of class A  In a next step to assess the cri­
teria for not causing significant harm (DNSH), documentation has been requested from property 
owners for a climate risk analysis to be carried out, documentation with information about the 
property's exposure to various climate-related risks and suggestions for appropriate actions 
and adaptations  However, information from property owners in 2023 was still insufficient to a 
large extent, and verification of whether activities are Taxonomy-aligned could only be com­
pleted for 0 5% of the buildings  This lack of information is a clear indication that many com­
panies have not yet achieved a sufficient level of maturity in reporting  However, the work that 
has been carried out has laid a foundation for the Group’s collaboration with third parties that 
will likely facilitate future reporting 
Reporting principles
The proportion of environmentally sustainable activities in accordance with the Taxonomy is to 
be disclosed through three financial key performance indicators (KPIs), broken down by each of 
the EU’s six environmental objectives  Axfood’s methodology for calculating these three KPIs is 
described below  The risk for double counting is mitigated as Axfood is only reporting on one 
environmental objective, Climate change mitigation  The other environmental objectives are 
deemed as not relevant with respect to the Group's economic activities 
Economic activities must meet the criteria for substantial contribution and DNSH, however 
in addition must also ensure that minimum protective measures are met  This means that 
Axfood has to ensure that the Group has routines and processes in place for managing human 
rights, anti-corruption, taxation, and fair competition  The Group's Code of Conduct also stipu­
lates that the Group is in line with guidelines such as the UN's Human Rights Declaration, the 
International Labour Organisation's (ILO) fundamental conventions, the UN Global Compact, 
the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multina­
tional Enterprises, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and Business Principles  
Axfood works according to a due diligence process for human rights which is described on page 
93, and the work with anti-corruption is handled on page 95  Axfood has a compliance policy 
and has also not breached its compliance with respect to legislation and regulations in taxation 
or competition law  Questions about honourable competition is handled in Axfood's ethical rules 
of conduct  The general assessment is therefore that the Group's existing routines and pro­
cesses are adequate to fulfil the minimum protective measures

TAXONOMY
Turnover
Net turnover corresponds to the reported revenue for the financial year (see net sales for the 
Group on page 45 and in Note 3)  Policies for consolidated revenue recognition are described 
in more detail in Note 1  The proportion of Axfood’s turnover that is Taxonomy-eligible corre­
sponds only to ­
e-commerce revenue from deliveries/freight 
Capital expenditures
Axfood’s non-current assets often comprise right-of-use assets for warehouse and store 
premises, vehicles and some other equipment  Axfood mainly leases its warehouse and store 
premises, which is why a majority of the Group’s reported non-current assets are attributable 
to right-of-use assets for leases signed by the Group  The property owner is usually responsi­
ble for maintenance, renovation and repairs (see Note 15)  Other investments in non-current 
assets consist of store and warehouse equipment, machinery and IT equipment, and vehicles 
The value of Taxonomy-eligible assets corresponds to the cost for these assets divided by 
total acquired non-current assets, including right-of-use assets during the current reporting 
period (see notes 14, 15 and 20)  Total capital expenditures concerns additions to property, 
plant and equipment and intangible assets during the year after deducting depreciation/
amortisation and any impairment, with the exception of changes to fair value  Also included 
are additions to, and revaluations of, right-of-use assets as well as property, plant and equip­
ment and intangible assets related to business combinations  Goodwill is not included 
Operating expenses
According to the Taxonomy, Taxonomy-eligible operating expenses corresponds to direct, 
non-capitalised costs for day-to-day servicing that may be environmentally sustainable 
now or in the future  More specifically, this relates to, among other things, building renovation 
measures, short-term leases, maintenance and repair  For Axfood, this pertains mainly to 
maintenance costs for trucks  From a Group perspective, this share of costs is negligible since 
the financial impact is very limited  Accordingly, costs deemed to contribute to Axfood’s 
transition efforts by reducing GHG emissions, such as operating costs related to the 
Group’s solar panel systems, purchased green electricity and costs for fuels, are not 
covered by the Taxonomy 
Nuclear and fossil gas related activities
On 1 January 2023, a supplementary delegated act entered into force, whereby companies 
must now report the Taxonomy-alignment of certain nuclear and fossil gas related activities  
Nuclear energy and fossil gas have been deemed environmentally sustainable for the time 
being by the European Parliament, as they are considered important components of the tran­
sition to lower GHG emissions  Axfood does not currently conduct any activities in any of 
these areas

Introduction
We have been engaged by the Board of Directors of Axfood AB (publ) to undertake a 
­
limited assurance engagement of the Axfood Sustainability Report for the year 2023  
The Company has defined the scope of the Sustainability Report on page 76 in the Annual 
and Sustainability Report 2023 and the Statutory Sustainability Report on page 109 
Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management
The Board of Directors and the Executive Management are responsible for the prepa­
ration of the Sustainability Report including the Statutory Sustainability Report in 
accordance with the applicable criteria and the Annual Accounts Act respectively  The 
criteria are defined on page 76 in the Sustainability Report, and are part of the Sustain­
ability Reporting Guidelines published by GRI (Global Reporting Initiative), which are 
applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation prin­
ciples that the Company has developed  This responsibility also includes the internal 
control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material 
misstatements, whether due to fraud or error  Responsibilities of the auditor 
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on the 
limited assurance procedures we have performed and to express an opinion regarding 
the Statutory Sustainability Report  Our engagement is limited to historical information 
presented and does therefore not cover future-oriented information 
We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 
(revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial 
Information  A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of 
persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying ana­
lytical and other limited assurance procedures  Our examination regarding the Statu­
tory Sustainability Report has been conducted in accordance with FAR’s accounting 
standard RevR 12 The auditor’s opinion regarding the Statutory Sustainability Report  
A limited assurance engagement and an examination according to RevR 12 is different 
and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Interna­
tional Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden  The firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the 
firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including poli­
cies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional stan­
dards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements  We are independent of Axfood 
in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise 
fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements 
The limited assurance procedures performed and the examination according to RevR 
12 do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit  The conclusion based on a limited assur­
ance engagement and an examination according to RevR 12 does not provide the same 
level of assurance as a conclusion based on an audit 
Our procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the 
Executive Management as described above  We consider these criteria suitable for the 
preparation of the Sustainability Report 
We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to pro­
vide a basis for our conclusion below 
Conclusion
Based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report, is not prepared, in 
all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors 
and Executive Management  
A Statutory Sustainability Report has been prepared

The share of sales of sustainability-labelled products 
is to amount to at least 30% by 2025 the latest 
The share of sales of sustainability-labelled products, mainly 
Green Keyhole and organic products, amounted to 26 6% 
(26 6) for the year  Customers’ increased price consciousness 
as a result of high food price inflation has had a negative 
impact on these sales in the last few years 
2
Axfood is to promote more sustainable agriculture, including 
more biodiversity and reduced use of chemicals, by increasing 
the share of sales of organic food to at least 10% by 2025 
The share of sales of organic food amounted to 4 6% (5 1) for 
the year  This decrease was partly due to an increased price 
consciousness among customers as a result of high food price 
inflation, while the trend for the share of organic sales has 
declined for the industry as a whole in recent years 
3
The share of KRAV- and or Svenskt Sigill-labelled meat will 
increase for all store chains, and by at least 10% for Hemköp 
in particular 
The sale of KRAV and or Svenskt Sigill-labelled meat 
increased slightly during the year, amounting to 2 8% (2 7) 
4
Axfood’s store chains will sell only ecolabelled fish and shellfish 
products or products green-listed in the WWF’s fish guide by 
2025 at the latest  The approved labels are MSC, ASC, KRAV and 
Svenskt Sigill 
During the year, 65 4% (80 8) of the volume of fish and shell­
fish products sold in Axfood’s stores was certified or green-
listed according to the WWF’s fish guide  This decline was 
largely due to the fact that caviar lost its sustainability label­
ling, together with increased in-store sales of fish without 
sustainability labels 
5
Private label organic meat and charcuterie products will be 
certified primarily according to KRAV, and secondarily according 
to the EU organic certification  KRAV labels are preferred for 
organic products in other categories 
Dagab takes a systematic approach to these guidelines, 
which are part of Axfood’s quality and sustainability strategy 
6
All suppliers of private label meat and meat products will 
meet the requirement for animal welfare certification or 
equivalent by 2025 at the latest 
Dagab works systematically with the demand for animal 
welfare certification and is following up on the progress 
made with a quality assurance system  In procurement 
processes demands are placed through general terms 
and or the agreement 
7
Food waste from Willys, Hemköp, Snabbgross and Dagab will 
be cut in half by 2025 at the latest, compared to 1 7 percent in 
the base year 2015 
Food waste as a percentage of food retail sales decreased 
slightly during the year and amounted to 1 1% (1 2)  Clearance 
prices for products nearing their best-before dates, fruit and 
vegetable bargain bags and boxes in stores, and donations are 
examples of initiatives that have helped to reduce food waste 
8
Axfood is to offer a large and highly varied assortment of 
healthy products by developing the assortment and promoting 
offerings that guide consumers toward more fruit, vegetables, 
vegetable fats and products with less added sugar and salt 
Axfood offers a large range of healthy products, both private 
label and branded  The assortment of private label products is 
continually developed through launches of new sustainable 
and healthy products  Through Klubb Hemköp, customers are 
guided and rewarded for making more sustainable choices, 
such as purchasing organic products 
9
Only suppliers that actively promote reduced use of antibiotics 
according to current industry agreements are to be used for 
private label products  These requirements are also to be 
communicated to suppliers of branded products 
Dagab is systematically addressing the antibiotics require­
ment, and monitoring is taking place through a quality assur­
ance system  In procurement processes demands are placed 
through general terms and or the agreement  Achieved Ongoing Not achieved

Axfood will have net zero emissions from its own operations 
by 2030 at the latest  Emissions from own operations include 
emissions from Scope 1, Scope 2 and parts of Scope 3  
Emissions from own operations amounted to 46,475 tonnes of 
CO2 equivalents (44,571) for the year  The increase was mainly 
driven by increased emissions from procured transports due to the 
Group’s growth  Emissions from own transports and refrigerants 
decreased 
11
Axfood is to promote a more sustainable production and con­
sumption of food by annually reducing its climate impact per 
kilo of food sold through changes to the sales mix, by advocat­
ing for fossil-free agriculture in Sweden by 2030 and by encour­
aging the industry, authorities and politicians to support a 
reduced climate impact from food production 
In 2023, the estimated carbon footprint per kilo of food sold was 
1 9 CO2 equivalents (1 9)  Changing consumption patterns as a result 
of food price inflation, with increased meat consumption, impacted 
the sales mix  Collaboration is ongoing with both suppliers as well as 
with organisations, and Axfood annually publishes its suggestions 
for a sustainable food strategy in the Food 2030 report 
12
Axfood is to promote biodiversity and reduced deforestation 
from production of private label products  At least three 
projects to replace soy with sustainable food crops are to 
be carried out by no later than 2025  
Axfood has created a soy-free quark sold under the private label 
brand Garant and is participating in a project to develop alterna­
tive feeds for fish, birds and pigs 
13
Axfood will carry out a risk analysis regarding climate and 
biodiversity in the supply chain  This analysis will be the 
basis for measures to be initiated during 2024 
A risk analysis was carried out during the year to gain a better under­
standing of how climate change and biodiversity loss are affecting 
Axfood and its supply chain 
14
By 2025 at the latest, suppliers of private label products will 
have a publicly announced climate target of net zero emis­
sions from operations (Scope 1 and 2) by no later than 2030  
They will also have at least one publicly announced climate 
target aimed at significantly reducing the climate footprint 
of their supply chain (Scope 3) by 2025 at the latest  For addi­
tional information about this target, visit Axfood’s website 
The status of supplier climate agendas and emissions goals was 
determined during the year via a survey  Based on the results, 
work has been initiated that will form the basis for setting future 
procurement requirements in categories with significant climate 
footprints  The Climate Education Tool, designed to help formu­
late and follow up on emissions targets, was revised and trans­
lated to more languages 
15
Axfood will strive to increase the share of renewable ingredi­
ents in household chemical products, such as detergent and 
cleaners, by gradually phasing out fossil-based ingredients 
where alternatives exist 
Work is being carried out, with requirements regarding renewable 
ingredients included directly in the procurement of relevant 
­
products  
16
Axfood will reduce electricity consumption by 10% per square 
metre by no later than 2025 (base year 2020)  When establish­
ing and refurbishing stores and warehouses, sustainability per­
formance with respect to energy and choice of materials will 
maintain a high commercially available standard  Particular 
­
consideration will be given to a circular economy 
The target was achieved, since electricity consumption per square 
metre decreased by approximately 18% in 2023 compared with 
the base year 
17
Electricity consumption in warehouses will be reduced 
by at least 10% in relation to sales by no later than 2025 
(base year 2020)  
By the end of 2023, electricity consumption in relation to 
sales had decreased by approximately 9% compared with 
the base year 
18
For investments in store refrigeration systems, 
­
climate-friendly refrigerants shall always be used 
For investments in store and warehouse refrigeration systems, 
­
climate-friendly refrigerants are used  
19
Axfood will have at least 40 solar power facilities 
in operation by no later than 2025 
In total, 19 solar power facilities were in operation at year-end 
2023  Large rooftop solar panels went into operation at the new 
warehouses in Bålsta and Landskrona 
20
Dagab’s vehicle fleet will be differentiated with respect to 
sustainable fuels  No single vehicle type will make up more 
than half of the vehicle fleet by 2025 at the latest 
The fleet of vehicles is differentiated and includes a number of 
different types of vehicles that can be driven on various fuels  No 
single type of vehicle accounts for more than half of the total fleet

Dagab is to reduce CO2 emissions from Group-owned trucks by 
30% by 2025 (base year: 2020) 
In 2023, emissions declined to 9,235 tonnes CO2 equivalents, 
a reduction of 23% compared with the base year  A decision 
has been made to phase out fossil fuels in own as well as 
procured transports by using renewable fuel or electricity by 
2025 at the latest 
22
Transports by external transport companies by road from 
warehouses to Axfood’s stores will be fossil-free by 2030  
To support the Group’s transition, a transport model has been 
developed to facilitate procurement 
CO2 emissions from procured transports are increasing  
A decision has been made, however, to phase out fossil fuels 
in own as well as procured transports by using renewable fuel 
or electricity by 2025 
23
Dagab will also conduct carbon footprint reporting for incoming 
transports to warehouses by 2024 at the latest 
Work is ongoing to ensure reporting of external climate data 
24
The ambition at Axfood and its chains is to limit the assortment 
of fruits and vegetables transported by air and to promote an 
industry consensus 
A list of goods that are periodically shipped by air is 
available on the Group’s websites  Snabbgross no longer 
sells fruits, vegetables or meat transported by air 
25
Axfood will reduce the share of combustible residual products 
in relation to the number of kilos of goods sold 
Incinerated waste as a share of consolidated net sales 
decreased to 15 3% (17 1) 
26
All relevant suppliers that supply either private label products 
or fruits and vegetables with a large water footprint will use 
a recognised water standard or the equivalent by 2025 at the 
latest 
Work to develop water procedures for fresh fruits and vegeta­
bles is ongoing  Tests have been carried out to include addi­
tional goods  At the same time, follow-ups are being carried 
out for relevant fruit and vegetable suppliers to ensure they 
develop a water standard 
27
Axfood will have integrated extended sustainability criteria 
for the environmental and carbon footprint of products into 
the ­
procurement process by 2024 at the latest 
A pilot project is ongoing to identify how requirements 
for ­
climate and biodiversity agendas can be developed 
in the procurement process  The plan is to introduce the 
requirements in 2024 
28
Dagab will avoid SIN-listed chemicals in products and packaging 
by 2025  Axfood is working to promote the SIN list as the industry 
standard for chemical requirements 
Work is ongoing to drive the industry and increase the level 
of awareness about demands on suppliers  In addition, the 
existence of PFAS and bisphenols is being mapped 
29
Use of plastics for private label products and internal plastic flows 
will be reduced by 25% by no later than 2025 (base year 2019)  
Axfood will also help reduce the use of plastics and promote 
sustainable plastic use through partnerships with suppliers of 
branded products 
Work is ongoing to remove packaging components that do 
not serve a significant function  This initiative is being carried 
out throughout the sector to drive change  Extensive efforts 
are being made to change to packaging containing less or no

Packaging for private label products is to be made from circular 
materials, such as renewable or recycled raw materials, by no 
later than 2030  The use of FSC-labelled material in forestry 
goods will increase 
Using recycled raw materials is possible for most materials  
The largest challenge is within plastics, where progress is 
nevertheless moving forward  Sweden’s updated packaging 
legislation will drive this development

Packaging for private label products will be recyclable by 2025 
The conditions for what can be recycled are improving 
thanks to legislation and technological developments

Effective governance that creates the right conditions
Effective corporate governance and a clear framework are creating the conditions for Axfood to develop  
The Axfood Group is maintaining a high rate of development and a consistent approach of combining 
social responsibility and long-term thinking with growth  In 2023, the Group strengthened its position 
in all market segments, and Axfood took significant steps in the form of extensive future investments
in digitalisation, automation and sustainability 
With the ability to consistently navigate a changing and uncertain environment, Axfood can 
once again look back on an eventful and successful year  The market over the past year was 
challenging in many respects, characterised by high food price inflation and a related shift in 
customer behaviour  Willys’ performance was exceptional again this year, while Hemköp also 
succeeded in growing more than the market  The progress in the development of the Group’s 
other operations also confirms that Axfood’s model stands the test of time and holds up well 
in different market climates 
2023 was another year of rapid structural change  It has been gratifying to see the new 
logistics structure take shape, particularly the ramp-up of the new, highly automated 
logistics centre in Bålsta outside Stockholm  Together with other initiatives in areas such as 
digitalisation and sustainability, this is creating a new and stronger platform that will serve 
as the basis for future competitiveness  Axfood’s favourable position in the market, and its 
recent investments in efficient operation and an attractive customer offering will lay the foun­
dation for many years of continued growth and profitability 
Sustainability an integral part of the business model
Through its various concepts and activities, Axfood reaches millions of people every week  
This creates excellent opportunities and also entails great responsibility  Axfood’s purpose 
is to create a better quality of life for everyone by being a leader in affordable, good and 
sustainable food  Sustainability is a central and integral part of the business model and 
governance, and there is a strong commitment to taking the lead in promoting a sustainable 
food system  Household financial strain has created challenges for product categories with 
a price premium, including organic products  Even in this climate, Axfood wants to continue 
to raise its ambition level in areas such as renewable energy, renewable fuels and product 
development, with a focus on sustainable production and consumption of food with a lower 
climate impact  In addition, Axfood is expanding and strengthening its sustainability work in 
the parts of the value chain that lie outside the Company’s own operations, in areas such as 
climate, biodiversity and human rights 
Corporate governance that creates order and the right conditions
Effective corporate governance is crucial for delivering a successful earnings performance 
and assuming social responsibility  The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring the 
right organisation is in place, which in turn facilitates effective decision-making, a clear 
distribution of roles and responsibilities between management and control bodies, effective 
follow-up within internal systems, and internal control over financial reporting  The Board is 
also responsible for ensuring that the Company’s disclosure of information is characterised 
by openness and transparency in relation to the capital market 
Our Board work is carried out in close dialogue with the Executive Committee and is char­
acterised by deep commitment and a variety of perspectives  Over the past year, the Board 
supported management in strategic decisions and priorities related to changes in the macro 
environment and the Group’s major investments, which are made to ensure continued profit­
able growth  The Board also focused on sustainability issues, and all directors completed 
Axfood’s mandatory sustainability training during the year  As in previous years, the annual 
evaluation of the Board’s work showed very positive results 
Well positioned to create long-term value
I am proud of Axfood’s achievements and that the company is well positioned to continue 
creating value for its stakeholders in the years to come  Based on the Group’s strong financial 
position and stable cash flow, the Board proposes to the AGM a dividend of SEK 8 50 (8 15) per 
share  President and CEO Klas Balkow has given us notice that he will be leaving his current 
role by year-end 2024 at the latest, but will thereafter be available for Axfood in an advisory 
role  The recruitment process to find Klas’ replacement has been initiated 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow directors for their solid teamwork 
and constructive contributions over the past year  I would also like to thank Axfood’s 
­
Executive Committee and employees for their commitment and dedication  Finally, I would 
like to thank you, our shareholders, for your confidence and support

carried out  The results, which showed high scores in all categories, demonstrates that the 
Board’s work is well-functioning and also indicates a good relationship with a high level of 
trust between the Board and management  The company has a clear strategy and well-con­
sidered financial targets with a clear link to the business plan in which the operations are fol­
lowed up against  The Board’s engagement is strong and all Board members have high partici­
pation rates in meetings  The results of this evaluation were reported to the Nominating 
Committee in November and to the Board in December

discussions, and at least one annual strategy meeting  The store establishment and financing 
committee, which is linked to the Executive Committee, also meets once a month to address 
matters concerning store investments, store divestments, new leases and renewals of existing 
leases  The Executive Committee is also part of a sustainability forum that meets quarterly to 
address issues related the Group’s sustainability efforts  An annual business plan is adopted 
by Axfood’s Board at the end of the year after being drafted by the subsidiaries and the 
Executive Committee  The work on the business plan thereby involves employees from several 
levels within the Group  The business plan is addressed by the Executive Committee and is 
thus a dynamic planning and follow-up document  
The subsidiaries are governed by their respective Boards  Axfood’s President and CEO 
serves as Chairman of the larger subsidiaries’ Boards  The other directors on the subsidiaries’ 
Boards consist of various representatives from the Executive Committee as well as a number 
of other Group executives with relevant expertise regarding each company  The subsidiaries 
hold Board meetings on a regular basis, and the larger subsidiaries hold at least four regular 
Board meetings a year 
A more detailed presentation of the Executive Committee is provided on page 125 
Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives 
Guidelines for remuneration to senior executives were adopted by the 2023 AGM based on 
a proposal by the Board of Directors and are to apply not longer than until the 2027 AGM 
The guidelines cover the President and CEO of Axfood and members of the Executive 
Committee, who report directly to the President and CEO  The guidelines do not cover remu­
neration decided on by the general meeting of shareholders, such as directors’ fees or share-
based incentive programmes  The guidelines are to be applied for remuneration that is agreed 
upon – and changes made to already agreed-upon remuneration – after the guidelines were 
adopted by the 2023 AGM  The guidelines govern the decisions on remuneration that are 
made by the Board’s Remuneration Committee with respect to senior executives who report 
directly to the CEO and by the Board as a whole with respect to the CEO  
Axfood shall offer remuneration that is in line with the going rate in the market and that is 
based on factors such as the importance of the work duties and the executive’s expertise, 
experience, performance and, as regards variable remuneration, achievement of previously 
set targets  Remuneration may consist of a fixed base salary, short-term variable remunera­
tion, pension benefits, insurance and other benefits  In addition, a general meeting of share­
holders may – and independent of these guidelines – decide on share-based and share 
price-related remuneration 
For a complete account of the adopted guidelines, see Note 6 
Every AGM since 2017 has resolved to introduce long-term incentive programmes covering 
long-term variable remuneration for senior executives  
Short-term variable remuneration is expensed during the financial year and is paid out after 
the AGM has adopted the income statement and balance sheet  The guidelines adopted by 
the 2023 AGM have been followed, and all previously decided remuneration not yet paid out is 
within the described framework

120 AXFOOD ANNUAL AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023
The Board’s report on internal control
In accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Code, the Board is responsible for 
ensuring that the Company has well-designed internal controls and solid processes in place 
to ensure that the financial reporting is controlled in a satisfactory manner  Internal control 
at  Axfood is based on the COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework, which has been 
adapted to the operation  The framework consists of the following components: control envi­
ronment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring  
Axfood’s CFO has the primary responsibility for ensuring that the work with and monitoring 
of the internal controls are conducted in accordance with the method decided on by the 
Board  The internal control function is responsible for the ongoing work and for reporting 
results and conclusions to the Audit Committee and the Board  
Control environment
The control environment forms the basis of the internal control framework  Decision-making 
channels, authorisations and responsibilities are clearly defined and communicated throughout 
the organisation  In addition, governance documents such as internal policies, guidelines, manu­
als and handbooks are available to all employees  Axfood’s Board has established defined pro­
cesses and rules of procedure for the Board and its committees  An Audit Committee has been 
established for the reporting  
To create a solid foundation for internal control and to maintain a high standard within the 
Group, the Board has adopted a number of fundamental governance documents, including 
rules of procedure for the Board and President, a finance and credit policy, and a compliance 
policy  In addition, the Board has ensured that the organisational structure lays out clear roles, 
responsibilities and processes that ensure effective management of risks and internal control, 
thereby enabling goal achievement  
The internal control function works continuously on developing, adapting and improving 
Axfood’s control environment  The purpose of this is to maintain a control environment that 
is functional and effective, while also ensuring high-quality and reliable reporting 
Risk assessment
Axfood continuously evaluates the risk of errors in the financial reporting to ensure that they 
are managed  Risk are assessments at least twice a year and on a continuing basis as needed  
Based on the results, the Audit Committee evaluates and decides which risks to take into con­
sideration in order to ensure reasonable internal control over financial reporting  For a more 
detailed description of risks and risk management, see pages 28–32  
Control activities
Axfood’s control activities derive from the most material risks that impact the reporting  These 
control activities are defined in the Group’s risk and control matrixes  The matrixes are specified 
by company and business-critical processes related to the financial reporting defined by the 
steering committee  Furthermore, an additional risk and control matrix is implemented to ensure 
that risks within Group-wide processes are effectively managed  
The control activities are designed according to a structure aimed at detecting and pre­
venting risks of errors in the reporting  In addition, the structure also ensures efficiency and 
reasonable control in all of the Group’s processes related to financial reporting  Examples of 
control activities include reconciliation of accounts, analyses of profit/loss items, inventory 
counts and user access reviews  
Information and communication
All of Axfood’s governance documents are communicated via the Group’s intranet and are 
updated annually to reflect any changes to internal and external requirements  Guidelines 
for internal control are announced in accordance with the Group’s communication structure 
and procedures for governance documents  
The internal control function reports the results of the year to the Audit Committee, 
primarily focusing on observations, recommendations and mitigating activities

Monitoring
The Board, through the Audit Committee, is responsible for the quality assurance of the Group’s 
monitoring of internal control  The internal control work, together with the external audit, pro­
vides support to the Board and Executive Committee in assessing and identifying material risk 
areas in the reporting process  This enables the possibility to assess efforts and follow-up 
­
initiatives in selected areas  Furthermore, the Group has a central risk management function  
The internal control function is responsible for the results and efficiency of the internal con­
trol, which is monitored through self-assessments  Any deviations are reported to the control 
and ­
process owner to remediate noted deficiencies  The results of the self-assessments and 
the outcome of the external audit are reported to the Audit Committee and the Board  
Focus areas during the year
During the year, Axfood worked to further improve and strengthen the shared control frame­
work, with a particular focus on sustainability reporting  In addition, training in internal control 
was carried out to create a better understanding and basis for a solid performance in this 
area

Assessment of a separate audit function
Axfood does not have a separate audit function, meaning an 
internal audit function  The Audit Committee and the Board have 
considered the matter of a separate audit function and concluded 
that the existing risk management structure and monitoring of 
internal control provide a satisfying level of reliability  The Board 
evaluates the need for a separate audit function every year and 
its decision is noted in the minutes

Auditor’s report on the 
corporate governance report
To the general meeting of the shareholders in Axfood AB (publ)
corporate identity number 556542-0824
Engagement and responsibility
It is the board of directors who is responsible for the corporate governance report for the 
financial year 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 on pages 115-125 and that it has been 
prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act 
The scope of the audit
Our examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR’s standard RevR 16 The audi­
tor’s examination of the corporate governance statement  This means that our examination ­
of the corporate governance report is different and substantially less in scope than an audit 
conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted 
auditing standards in Sweden  We believe that the examination has provided us with suffi­
cient basis for our opinions 
Opinions
A corporate governance report has been prepared  Disclosures in accordance with ­
chapter 6 
section 6 the second paragraph points 2-6 the Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 
the second paragraph the same law are consistent with the annual accounts and the consoli­
dated accounts and are in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act

Financial key ratios
In addition to the financial key ratios prepared in accordance with 
IFRS, Axfood presents financial key ratios that are not defined by 
IFRS or by the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, so-called alternative 
performance measures (APMs)  These APMs aim to provide supple­
mentary information that contributes to analysing Axfood’s opera­
tions and development  The APMs used are considered generally 
accepted in the industry  APMs should not be seen as a substitute for 
financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, but as a 
complement  The APMs are defined below under the financial key 
ratio definitions  
Some APMs are also reported excluding IFRS 16 to enable a follow-up 
of operational development excluding the technical accounting 
effects as a result of IFRS 16  Some APMs are also reported excluding 
items affecting comparability since the adjusted performance mea­
sure provides a better understanding of the operations’ underlying 
development when comparing between periods
